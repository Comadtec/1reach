								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rise of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwincunningham/2016/03/22/why-messaging-is-the-business-interface-of-the-future/#7f41a5ed6d3e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">messaging for business communication</a> has taken the world by storm, and your contact center needs to be ready to respond. But first, you need to make sure you’re responding on the right channels.</p>
<p>Research done by Harris Poll and commissioned by OneReach found that <a href="http://onereach.com/resources/high-demand-for-text-message-2014-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 60% of customers</a> would rather text than call your business for support. With texting, customers can get a faster, more efficient response to their questions. This value can be seen within customer communications, as well as internal workforce communications.</p>
<h2><span id="more-7411"></span><strong>Contact Centers</strong></h2>
<p>In our experience, texting has been shown to reduce call volume by 40% and decrease phone costs from $6-20 per call to $2-5 per interaction per text chat. By offering the option to pivot to text messaging within your call center’s IVR, your company can deflect calls to a less costly channel, reduce wait times and improve self-service options. In fact, over 40% of customers would prefer to text with an agent than wait on hold.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways texting can have a positive impact on your organization and make it more efficient. Organizations can use messaging to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Respond more with fewer agents.</strong> With text chat, agents can respond to multiple chats at once, lowering the number of agents needed to respond to customer inquiries. Bringing less agents in can help reduce costs but also improve quality of service, since managers can devote more attention to each individual agent. Contact centers can also use texting to send out alerts to customers on system updates or outages to help mitigate inbound call volume.</li>
<li><strong>Review transcripts.</strong> Text conversations, much like web chat, have an easily accessible transcript that can be reviewed and learned from through data mining and analysis of textual conversations. This is better than voice, where you cannot easily monitor quality or track recurring patterns. Contact center managers as well as agents can take a look at the conversations to see if agents were brand compliant, how long the conversation took, what and more. They can also review agent performance across channels and per agent. A solution that uses text analytics can help agents more easily track what customers are texting in about and track “hot terms” to help identify support issues.</li>
<li><strong>Guide the conversation.</strong> Most contact centers use scripts to help agents control the flow of the conversation and stay brand compliant. Your call center can take this to the next level with canned responses. Canned responses are answered recorded ahead of time that can help agents respond more quickly and make sure that answers provide the appropriate information. Canned responses can also be used to help train agents on how they should answer. Your contact center can also use artificial intelligence to autoselect an appropriate response based on a customer query.</li>
<li><strong>Send out automated surveys.</strong> In our experience, text surveys have been shown to get a 20% response rate, higher than the <a href="http://support2.constantcontact.com/articles/FAQ/2344" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15%</a> average of email surveys and <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/traditional/telephone-survey-response-rates-dropping-accuracy-remains-high-22107/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9% response rate</a> of phone surveys. With texting, you can set up automation to send an outbound survey as soon as they finish their conversation and have them rate their interaction on the same channel they responded on. It is natural to answer a survey after the text chat sessions because it is in the same thread. This helps ensure more accurate responses, as texters will better recall the content of a conversation closer to when the interaction happens. Your call center can then review these responses and adjust how customer service is delivered.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Corporate Communication Using Text Messaging</strong></h2>
<p>While the value of the text channel for consumers is starting to be realized by the enterprise, most organizations still do not understand the opportunity for improvement that text messaging can have on their internal workforce communications. Text messaging is a great technology to drive desired employee behavior and improve internal communications between distributed teams.</p>
<p>One great example is to use text messaging to improve communication within a field services organization. Text messages can be sent to field personnel to provide appointment reminders and ensure improved show rates on booked appointments. Text reminders can also include appointment details and ensure a field service person has what they need when they show up on the job.  From the customer perspective they can receive a reminder of the appointment and include a picture of the field service representative, creating a sense of trust and familiarity before the field personnel even arrives.</p>
<p>Companies can also use SMS internally for tasks such as reminding project team members to enter project hours or provide project status updates. The value of this channel is that the message can link directly to a mobile app or mobile web site and help improve employee adherence to internal processes using a channel they appreciate.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>The ultimate value of using text messaging within an organization does not stop at the customer. Using text messaging for corporate communication helps drive more efficient communication within the organization and improves task efficiency in the workforce. By interacting with customers and employees on a channel that’s proven to improve collaboration, reduce costs and get results, companies can ensure that they’re getting the most out of their communication technologies.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>To view the first post in the series, <a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=1373">click here</a>. To view the second post in the series, <a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=1471">click here</a>.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s the one thing small businesses are most concerned about? If you said money, you’re on the right track: </span><a href="http://www.waspbarcode.com/small-business-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 45% of small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cite growing revenue as their top concern.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-7252"></span>However, money is too simple an answer to accurately represent the struggles of small businesses. There are three primary factors that relate to how much money a company ultimately makes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Operational efficiency </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(What is my business doing to save time and effort?)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer experience </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(What is my business doing to keep customers coming back?)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Cost-cutting </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(What is my business doing to reduce costs?)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you relate these money concerns to business communications, small and medium businesses often  really struggle to find ways to convert standard business tools into mechanisms for reducing cost or driving more business. Take phone systems, for example &#8211; most businesses primarily rely on voice/calls and overlook the many ways that today’s communications tools can convert necessary evils like your phone system into tools that get results for you. </span></p>
<h1><b>Why Relying on Voice/Calls Alone Isn’t Enough</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t matter whether you own a retail store or run a small customer support department—you’re probably using voice/calls. A recent Dimension Data report found that</span><a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">65% of contact center interactions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are voice-based. However, voice comes with a lot of hidden costs that relate to the above factors:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Operational efficiency. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span><a href="http://www.impactlearning.com/customer-service-by-the-numbers-average-call-duration/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">BenchmarkPortal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the average call center call duration is 5.97 minutes. In addition,</span><a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/4084604_Call-type_classification_and_unsupervised_training_for_the_call_center_domain"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a call center study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the University of Colorado-Boulder found that over 30% of calls were either to adjust account settings (ie passwords) or fulfill other administrative tasks.  While this study was strictly focused on technology-based contact centers, </span><b>the point remains &#8211;  small businesses receive a lot of calls about pretty basic questions </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">(ie “What are your store hours?”, etc) that doesn’t require a real person fielding those calls (from a customer experience and operations/cost perspective). Fielding the same common questions over and over can cost businesses time, effort ($$$), which is hard to swallow when we’ve learned that for many of these questions, customers/callers just want an easy way to get the info they need.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer experience. </b><a href="http://onereach.com/resources/high-demand-for-text-message-2014-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">64% of customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prefer using text messaging to voice, and it’s easy to see why. Customers are </span><a href="http://www.parature.com/2013-customer-expectations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">often frustrated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by having to contact a company multiple times for the same reason (65%) or waiting on hold for a long time (62%)Some businesses have an IVR in place to manage calls, but only 7% of customers think the IVR delivers a better experience than speaking with a live person, according to a JD Power study.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Cost-cutting. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forrester research found that the average live agent call</span><a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/analystreports/enterprise-application/forrester-tei-atg-359304.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">costs $6-20 per interaction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Most small businesses can’t afford the money to hire a receptionist to answer calls, let alone answer all these calls in person. And businesses that don’t have an IVR or voicemail set up can let important calls can fall through the cracks, potentially losing valuable customers.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It sounds made up to say that there is a telephony/communication solution that saves small businesses money, automates processes, improves customer experience&#8230; and still routes to the right person when a real person is necessary. But it’s not made up. The solution is called Channel Pivot.</span></p>
<h1><b>How Channel Pivot Can Benefit Your Organization</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what exactly is Channel Pivot, and what can it do for your business? Simply put, it gives</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your callers the choice to automatically pivot out of a call, your IVR, hold or auto-attendant and right into self-service or live support via text message. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Channel Pivot maintains the context of the conversation, addressing the frustrating experience of customers having to repeat themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research conducted by Harris Poll found that</span><a href="http://onereach.com/resources/high-demand-for-text-message-2014-report"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">64% of customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would rather text your business for customer service. In addition, the study found that over 40% would prefer to press star to text with an agent immediately rather than wait on hold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Channel pivot also addresses the three main factors that contribute to a company’s bottom line in the following ways:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Operational efficiency.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When callers pivot from voice to SMS, you notably increase the likelihood of self-service successfully getting customers what they need without a real person. In addition, if a customer still needs a live agent, your support team can manage multiple SMS conversations at once , instead of just a single phone conversation.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Customer experience. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some customers will prefer to use text, and some will prefer to use voice. Channel Pivot lets them choose the channel they want, and when they want it. For example, there are some situations where it makes sense to switching to text (loud background noise, sensitive information, etc) while others merit speaking with a live agent over the phone (complex problems, too long to type). By letting customers use channels they prefer or need in a certain situation, businesses with Channel Pivot can ensure that customers feel respected and are always having a good experience.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Cost savings. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the great things about text messaging is that it costs significantly less than voice. While a supporting a customer over the phone </span><a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/analystreports/enterprise-application/forrester-tei-atg-359304.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">costs an average of $13</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a text chat interaction (where the agents responds from a web interface) is much cheaper with automation and the ability to manage multiple conversations at once. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this is all theory, right? What does channel pivot look like in action?</span></p>
<h1><b>Channel Pivot: A Case Study</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of our clients, a staffing agency, had been using a clunky IVR for several years and finally decided it was time to make a change. Associates and agents were frustrated by an IVR that was detached and difficult to navigate, and if that wasn’t enough, voice costs were going up 20% every year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After conducting some research, they found that adding a text channel would help reduce call volume. They liked the immediacy and mobility that came from using text messaging as well. Using OneReach, they were able to switch customers from calling  to SMS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, they hoped to deflect 20% of calls to SMS. Unfortunately, they missed the mark&#8230;as </span><b>over 40% </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">of calls were deflected to SMS using channel pivot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were ecstatic. By deflecting nearly half of their calls, the staffing agency was able to get significantly more results with exactly the same resources.. In addition, customers were also much happier using texting, even sending along smiley faces, and agents were able to answer more pressing calls while many customers get what they needed through  SMS self-service.</span></p>
<h1><b>Conclusion</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Channel pivot can save you money, while improving customer experience and your staff’s experience (multiple chats at once, and dealing with happier customers). All of these improvements can be amplified through thoughtful SMS self-service experiences and are easy, fast and affordable for your business to try.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>To view the first post in the series, <a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=1373">click here</a>.</em></p>
<p>If you’re anything like me, you’re bothered (maybe even offended) by retail businesses answering the phone instead of helping patrons.</p>
<p>We’ve all seen it happen. A customer is waiting  to check out when the clerk answers the phone (sometimes several times), often only to respond to the caller with store hours or the address. On behalf of the patron who’s standing there waiting and the caller, I’m annoyed by this.</p>
<p><span id="more-7221"></span>Here’s a thought &#8211; we all text. You text and your customers text. So perhaps it’s time to look at text-enabling your retail business. <a href="http://onereachcontactcenter.com/high-demand-for-customer-service-via-text-message/">According to a study</a> conducted by Harris Poll and commissioned by OneReach, 64% of customers who text would rather text than call your business. If customers could text your business, the activities they would prefer to do the most would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check order status (38%)</li>
<li>Schedule or change appointments (32%)</li>
<li>Make or confirm reservations (31%)</li>
<li>Ask a question (30%)</li>
<li>Find a store location (30%)</li>
<li>Check balances or due dates (30%)</li>
<li>Refill orders (29%)</li>
<li>Reset password (27%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Think how much easier it would be for your customers to do all these tasks over text. Instead of having to wait on hold or wait in line to get helped, you could solve problems with a text message or two.</p>
<p>If your business was text-enabled&#8230;</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Customers who have predictable questions could get what they need without interrupting your staff</b> (or customers who are standing right there waiting for you to get off the phone!). One company that did a pilot with OneReach found that 65% of people were calling in just to reset their password. That’s a lot of time and money just to answer a simple question that could easily be automated. By letting people text in and reply with automated, actionable answers, retailers can save customers time while devoting effort to the people who are literally right in front of them.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>For example: &#8220;Thanks for texting Acme Co. For directions and hours reply 1…&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><b>You could offer callers the ability to switch from calling you to continuing via text message. </b>We like to call this “the channel pivot.” One of OneReach’s customers was able to divert 40% of their calls to text by offering a text option, which drove up  satisfaction for customers and some really serious cost-reductions for our customer. In fact, our Harris Poll study found that 44% of customers would prefer to text with an agent rather than wait on hold. Letting customers switch to text is just more convenient for everyone &#8211; you can get on with your life while still getting what you need.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>For example: &#8220;Thanks for calling. Did you know you can text us now? To continue via text message, reply # or stay on the line to continue with this call.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><b>You could still help callers without interrupting customers in your store/business</b>. Callers/texters that need more than automated options could still chat live with your staff &#8211; customers could text from their mobile phone and your team could respond via web chat from a desktop, laptop or tablet. It’s far more convenient for both you and your customers, because they can stay on the device and channel they’re using rather than having to transfer to another one.</li>
<li><b>You’d save money.</b> If you’re offering automated answers to the most commonly asked questions, all via SMS, then you’re cutting down on phone costs. Answering the phone costs money and gets in the way of other sales. If customers still  need live support via SMS (and you’re responding via web chat), you can chat with more than one customer at once, something you can’t do with voice. (You don’t have apologize to whoever’s standing in front of you when you answer the phone instead of helping them). Helping more customers means more money (and more return customers!).</li>
<li><b>Customers will be more satisfied.</b> It sucks to wait on the phone while someone puts you on hold. Our Harris Poll study found that 64% of customers would be likely to have a positive perception of a company that offers texting, and 41% would be likely to feel the company understands their time is important. If customers could text you, they could get on with their lives instead of waiting around on hold, etc. The only thing that perhaps sucks more than being put on hold is standing at a cash register, wielding cash or plastic for your purchase, only to be ignored while a clerk answers a phone call.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you think even some of these possibilities are worth more than $65 bucks a month to you and your customers, then you have no excuse. You could be up and running in about as long as it took you to read this article.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Whenever people call a business, they want information; they don’t necessarily want to speak with someone.  By forcing callers to go through a complicated phone tree, wait on hold before speaking with someone, or being asked to visit a website, the callers is being forced to go through extra steps that result in feelings of frustration. In fact, <a href="http://onereachcontactcenter.com/high-demand-for-customer-service-via-text-message/">81% of customers feel frustrated being tied to a phone or computer </a>for customer support. By allowing the caller to opt-out of a complicated voice experience and into a more convenient channel such as SMS, you can show your customers that you honor their preferences.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7143"></span>This concept of channel pivot- or where a voice caller pivots away from the call and into a text chat by pressing a number on their keypad- is a great way to enhance the experience for both parties.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Text chat is pretty much what it sounds like: customers can text a company to chat with them. Getting a bit more technical, customers send a text message into a company, and an agent is notified through a web-based platform that a customer is waiting. Thanks to a seamless integration between SMS and web chat, agents answer on their computer, customers receive the message on their cell, and so the text chat goes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the great things about text chat is that it empowers everyone. Instead of getting stuck on hold, customers can channel pivot between voice and text when they want without losing context. Instead of being restricted to one call at a time, agents can field multiple customer questions at once. And, instead of being helpless to respond to customer demand, companies can show customers they’re evolving to meet their needs by surprising them with text chat. But the benefits for the company don’t end there:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved customer experience:</strong> Over 40% of customers would prefer to switch from waiting on hold to texting with an agent, so letting customers choose how they want to communicate creates a way more satisfactory (not to mention quicker) experience. If they have a better time getting help with your product or service, they’ll be more likely to use it again. If they have a really, really good experience, they might just even rave about it to their friends.</li>
<li><strong>Cost savings:</strong> According to a Forrester report, the average agent phone cost is between $6-20 depending on the type of call. Web chat, by comparison, only costs $2-5 per chat session; automating text chat lowers costs to just 25 cents per session. In theory, if a contact center directed 1/3 of its calls to text chat and automation, they could see an immediate 25% savings.</li>
<li><strong>Audit trail:</strong> It’s a lot easier to keep track of a text conversation than a phone conversation, which can be both a blessing and a curse. If the auditors do come calling (or texting), text chat expedites the process since everything is already transcribed.</li>
<li><strong>Training:</strong> Text chat is a great way for management to monitor the customer interactions of new hires. Instead of breathing down the employee’s neck during a call, bosses can back off a little and still make sure everything is going appropriately.</li>
<li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Companies can best minimize costs and maximize the customer experience using text chat. It not only speeds up the entire service process, but it also increases the number of conversations agents can manage, and ultimately, the number of customer problems solved.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">As the world becomes increasingly mobilized, support systems need to be able to keep pace. Text chat just does that: it meets customers where they are (on the go) without stopping them in their tracks. With that level of service, thumb-based support gets two thumbs up.</p>
