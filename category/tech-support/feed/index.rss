								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rise of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwincunningham/2016/03/22/why-messaging-is-the-business-interface-of-the-future/#7f41a5ed6d3e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">messaging for business communication</a> has taken the world by storm, and your contact center needs to be ready to respond. But first, you need to make sure you’re responding on the right channels.</p>
<p>Research done by Harris Poll and commissioned by OneReach found that <a href="http://onereach.com/resources/high-demand-for-text-message-2014-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 60% of customers</a> would rather text than call your business for support. With texting, customers can get a faster, more efficient response to their questions. This value can be seen within customer communications, as well as internal workforce communications.</p>
<h2><span id="more-7411"></span><strong>Contact Centers</strong></h2>
<p>In our experience, texting has been shown to reduce call volume by 40% and decrease phone costs from $6-20 per call to $2-5 per interaction per text chat. By offering the option to pivot to text messaging within your call center’s IVR, your company can deflect calls to a less costly channel, reduce wait times and improve self-service options. In fact, over 40% of customers would prefer to text with an agent than wait on hold.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways texting can have a positive impact on your organization and make it more efficient. Organizations can use messaging to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Respond more with fewer agents.</strong> With text chat, agents can respond to multiple chats at once, lowering the number of agents needed to respond to customer inquiries. Bringing less agents in can help reduce costs but also improve quality of service, since managers can devote more attention to each individual agent. Contact centers can also use texting to send out alerts to customers on system updates or outages to help mitigate inbound call volume.</li>
<li><strong>Review transcripts.</strong> Text conversations, much like web chat, have an easily accessible transcript that can be reviewed and learned from through data mining and analysis of textual conversations. This is better than voice, where you cannot easily monitor quality or track recurring patterns. Contact center managers as well as agents can take a look at the conversations to see if agents were brand compliant, how long the conversation took, what and more. They can also review agent performance across channels and per agent. A solution that uses text analytics can help agents more easily track what customers are texting in about and track “hot terms” to help identify support issues.</li>
<li><strong>Guide the conversation.</strong> Most contact centers use scripts to help agents control the flow of the conversation and stay brand compliant. Your call center can take this to the next level with canned responses. Canned responses are answered recorded ahead of time that can help agents respond more quickly and make sure that answers provide the appropriate information. Canned responses can also be used to help train agents on how they should answer. Your contact center can also use artificial intelligence to autoselect an appropriate response based on a customer query.</li>
<li><strong>Send out automated surveys.</strong> In our experience, text surveys have been shown to get a 20% response rate, higher than the <a href="http://support2.constantcontact.com/articles/FAQ/2344" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15%</a> average of email surveys and <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/traditional/telephone-survey-response-rates-dropping-accuracy-remains-high-22107/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9% response rate</a> of phone surveys. With texting, you can set up automation to send an outbound survey as soon as they finish their conversation and have them rate their interaction on the same channel they responded on. It is natural to answer a survey after the text chat sessions because it is in the same thread. This helps ensure more accurate responses, as texters will better recall the content of a conversation closer to when the interaction happens. Your call center can then review these responses and adjust how customer service is delivered.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Corporate Communication Using Text Messaging</strong></h2>
<p>While the value of the text channel for consumers is starting to be realized by the enterprise, most organizations still do not understand the opportunity for improvement that text messaging can have on their internal workforce communications. Text messaging is a great technology to drive desired employee behavior and improve internal communications between distributed teams.</p>
<p>One great example is to use text messaging to improve communication within a field services organization. Text messages can be sent to field personnel to provide appointment reminders and ensure improved show rates on booked appointments. Text reminders can also include appointment details and ensure a field service person has what they need when they show up on the job.  From the customer perspective they can receive a reminder of the appointment and include a picture of the field service representative, creating a sense of trust and familiarity before the field personnel even arrives.</p>
<p>Companies can also use SMS internally for tasks such as reminding project team members to enter project hours or provide project status updates. The value of this channel is that the message can link directly to a mobile app or mobile web site and help improve employee adherence to internal processes using a channel they appreciate.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>The ultimate value of using text messaging within an organization does not stop at the customer. Using text messaging for corporate communication helps drive more efficient communication within the organization and improves task efficiency in the workforce. By interacting with customers and employees on a channel that’s proven to improve collaboration, reduce costs and get results, companies can ensure that they’re getting the most out of their communication technologies.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, a bunch of fellow #ICMIchat-ers and I met to discuss our customer service crushes, just in time for Valentine’s Day. Some of the regular suspects were mentioned (Amazon and Zappos, naturally), but it got me to thinking—what are some other brands that are doing customer service really well? What really makes them great, and what could they do to continue to stay great?</p>
<p>I decided to do a little research of my own to see if I could find more examples of companies with great customer service, and I wasn’t disappointed. While this is by no means an exhaustive list, here are seven companies whose customer service makes us swoon (and could be made even more “crushworthy” with a few key tweaks).</p>
<h2><span id="more-7394"></span><strong>1. Zappos</strong></h2>
<p>Zappos is basically the gold standard in customer service. They’re known for doing above and beyond for their customers, some of which is outlined in their <a href="http://www.zappos.com/d/about-zappos-culture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ten core values</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Deliver WOW Through Service; Embrace and Drive Change; Create Fun and A Little Weirdness; Be Adventurous, Creative, and Open-Minded; Pursue Growth and Learning; Build Open and Honest Relationships With Communication; Build a Positive Team and Family Spirit; Do More With Less; Be Passionate and Determined; Be Humble.</p></blockquote>
<p>Their support stories have also reached an almost mythic level. Take, for instance, the team member who went to a rival shoe store to get someone shoes when <a href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=35871X943606&amp;site=businessinsider.com&amp;xs=1&amp;isjs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.practicalecommerce.com%2Farticles%2F2662-The-Zappos-Effect-5-Great-Customer-Service-Ideas-for-Smaller-Businesses&amp;xguid=59f5d4db8299c6124647bd6a508b416a&amp;xuuid=1c55cfd6628dc55a1564cda8d412db82&amp;xsessid=23c4b808f0c97b40b0c561d7fcaad844&amp;xcreo=0&amp;xed=0&amp;sref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fzappos-customer-service-crm-2012-1&amp;pref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;xtz=420" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zappos was sold out</a>. Or the time they <a href="http://consumerist.com/2011/05/zappos-saves-best-man-from-going-barefoot-at-wedding.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overnighted shoes</a> to a best man who needed a pair at no cost. The great thing about Zappos is that they’re able to deliver on that service across channels—they’ve got live chat, email, phone, and social support available 24/7, all backed by their dedicated Customer Loyalty team. On social, they’re not afraid to have a little fun with emojis and GIFs, but at the end of the day, they’re all about putting the customer first.</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.icmi.com/~/media/Images/Resources/Articles/2016/01/Crushworthy1.ashx?h=245&amp;w=600" alt="Zappos Social Media Customer Service" width="600" height="245" /></div>
<p>But Zappos doesn’t want to just help customers (although they do that very well)—they also want to help other customer service organizations. Take a visit to Las Vegas and you’ll find their <a href="http://www.zapposinsights.com/training/school-of-wow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">School of WOW</a>, where customer service managers can learn about Zappos’ company philosophy to help improve their own organization.</p>
<p>strong&gt;What they can do to continue “crushing” customer service: As mentioned above, they’re able to provide customer service across multiple channels, which is a must for any organization today. What they could do to make it even better is to ensure that it’s omnichannel—integrate their various service channels so that customers can switch between them without losing context. They do a great job of managing questions one channel, like Twitter, and can make their already great service better by providing an omnichannel experience.</p>
<h2>2. Nordstrom</h2>
<p>Nordstrom has this customer service commitment on <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/c/customer-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their website</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have a long-standing commitment to provide our customers with the best possible service every time they shop and to continually maintain a strong and lasting relationship with them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Their dedication to providing the best service possible helps inform the following situations, like when they let a customer <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/blog/retail_radar/2012/09/nordstrom-tales-of-legendary-customer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">return tires</a> there, or when they searched for hours to help a customer <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/business/tale-of-lost-diamond-adds-glitter-to-nordstroms-customer-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find a lost diamond</a> from her engagement ring that was sucked up by vacuum cleaner. They’ve also got a strong customer service presence online, be live chat, email, phone, or social support (all of which are available 24/7). On Twitter in particular, they’re helping customers <a href="https://twitter.com/Nordstrom/status/697861564850970624" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find the right clothes</a>, offering to <a href="https://twitter.com/Nordstrom/status/697917531235950592" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replace an out of stock coat</a>, and even giving kudos to their <a href="https://twitter.com/Nordstrom/status/697930349440069632" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customers’ fashion choices</a>.</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.icmi.com/~/media/Images/Resources/Articles/2016/01/Crushworthy2.ashx?h=273&amp;w=600" alt="Nordstrom Customer Service" width="600" height="273" /></div>
<p>While Nordstrom provides great digital service, it’s their in-person service that truly differentiates them from the competition. On <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Nordstrom-known-for-their-good-customer-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quora</a>, Ambra Benjamin, a former employee, explained that they added a personal touch that many other retailers don’t. For example, they walk you over to an item rather than point at it, but they also walk purchase around the counter. They also <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/business/tale-of-lost-diamond-adds-glitter-to-nordstroms-customer-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ring up purchases without you having to standing in line</a>. Talk about luxury service!</p>
<p><strong>What they can do to continue “crushing” customer service</strong>: As mentioned above, their personal touch is what really separates them from the competition. But one way to continue to knock their digital customer service out of the park is to add that same level of personalization to customer communications. Including a customer name in a tweet or email is a great touch, but sending them a link to a pair of jeans that would go great with that halter top they just bought? Now that’s personalized service.</p>
<h2>3. Southwest Air</h2>
<p>Southwest is one of the most well-known airlines in the U.S., but they don’t really see themselves that way. Here’s what they have to say about themselves on <a href="https://www.southwest.com/html/customer-service/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their website</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>We like to think of ourselves as a Customer Service company that happens to fly airplanes (on schedule, with personality and perks along the way).</p></blockquote>
<p>Their dedication to customer service is renowned, so much so that they’ve pinned a tweet showcasing a great service story on their <a href="https://twitter.com/SouthwestAir/status/692871649197043712" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter page</a>. The story is as follows: when a woman who had been training for a relay race landed at their airport, her shoes and running gear didn’t show up. Distressed, the woman was about ready to go to Walmart to buy shoes, but a Southwest team member drove 3 hours to deliver the bag to her when it arrived so that she could continue with her team and go on with the race.</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.icmi.com/~/media/Images/Resources/Articles/2016/01/Crushworthy3.ashx?h=369&amp;w=600" alt="Southwest Airlines Customer Service" width="600" height="369" /></div>
<p>Southwest absolutely dominates social customer support. While they’re available 24/7 for phone support, and also offer a knowledge base, email support, and a mobile app, social is where they shine. They’ve amassed over two million followers and make sure to respond to tweets within five minutes. When they’re not responding to inquirers, there’s no love lost between <a href="https://twitter.com/SouthwestAir/status/698018115460796416" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customers</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/SouthwestAir/status/698009842540158976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">airline</a>. (Also, their NYSE ticket symbol is LUV).</p>
<p><strong>What they can do to continue “crushing” customer service</strong>: Southwest does social support and in-person very well. They’re also doing a great job of using alternative channels like text messaging for <a href="https://www.southwest.com/html/generated/help/faqs/rapid_rewards_mobile_rapid_rewards_faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">loyalty programs</a>and <a href="https://www.southwest.com/flight/flight-notification-subscribe.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flight alerts</a>, as well as traditional channels like voice to change flights, check status, etc. One change they could make to improve their already great customer service is to allow customers to <a href="http://onereach.com/resources/high-demand-for-text-message-2014-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pivot from voice to text</a> to text chat with an agent immediately, something 44% of customers would prefer.</p>
<h2>4. REI</h2>
<p>When you think of the great outdoors, you probably don’t think about customer service. That’s because you’re not thinking about REI. They’ve got a strong commitment to helping customers live an <a href="http://www.rei.com/about-rei.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outdoor lifestyle</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our core purpose guides everything we do: we all work to inspire, educate and outfit for a lifetime of outdoor adventure and stewardship.</p></blockquote>
<p>And when it comes to customer service, they do just that. They offer live chat seven days a week, a really robust FAQ section, and even let them fax you if you so desired. On social, they help customers <a href="https://twitter.com/REI/status/696732171189538816" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find the right product</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/REI/status/695648949957435393" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">direct customers to repair services</a>, and more. They also <a href="https://twitter.com/REI/status/695692220708560896" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">encourage customers</a> to be brand advocates and help share their stories, further promoting the idea of their great customer service.</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.icmi.com/~/media/Images/Resources/Articles/2016/01/Crushworthy4.ashx" alt="REI customer service" width="591" height="322" /></div>
<p>As mentioned above, REI has a really robust FAQ section, and nowhere is that more evident than in their awesome <a href="http://www.rei.com/video" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video page</a>. There, they offer a huge video library showing customers how to do common outdoor tasks like sizing skiboots or slacklining. And given that customers want to be up and running (literally) with their gear in as little time as possible, there’s no better way to serve them.</p>
<p><strong>What they can do to continue “crushing” customer service</strong>: As mentioned, REI has a strong FAQ section and video page, but they could take both of those to the next level. They might consider adding a forum where customers can ask questions about how to use their new gear, or what are the best places to visit to use that new gear. Then, they could get answers from other people who have more experience. This would let their customers share their passion with the outdoors and encourage interaction with the brand after the purchase.</p>
<h2>5. Amazon</h2>
<p>It’s not hard to see how Amazon offers great customer service. Their commitment to service goes all the way up to the CEO, Jeff Bezos, who said this:</p>
<blockquote><p>We see our customers as invited guests to a party, and we are the hosts. It&#8217;s our job every day to make every important aspect of the customer experience a little bit better.</p></blockquote>
<p>And that they do. One great story is how they shipped a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/05/technology/05nocera.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new Playstation 3</a> free of charge on Christmas Eve so a little boy’s Christmas would be that much for magical. They’ve also got a robust <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ie=UTF8&amp;id=help" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">knowledge base and forums</a>, and they offer email and phone support. They post content proactively on Twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/AmazonHelp/status/680802760942555136" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">answer customer questions</a> before they ask them, and they have a dedicated Twitter help account which responds in multiple languages 24/7.</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.icmi.com/~/media/Images/Resources/Articles/2016/01/Crushworthy5.ashx" alt="Amazon customer service" width="580" height="158" /></div>
<p>While there’s no outlined policy (that I could find) telling reps to let loose, they’re certainly not afraid to inject a little fun into proceedings, web chatting with customers as <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/28/amazon-thor-customer-conversation_n_5725706.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thor and Odin</a> and using <a href="https://twitter.com/AmazonHelp/status/694522913786089472" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emojis and Vines</a> when responding to tweets. (There also must be something in the Seattle water—REI, Nordstrom and Amazon are all situated in the heart of the Northwest).</p>
<p><strong>What they can do to continue “crushing” customer service</strong>: As discussed above, Amazon is doing a great job of helping customers in need. They also have great self-service options. What they could do to make their phone and email support better is to make it easily accessible. I had to search through their site quite a bit before finding the traditional methods to contact them. Having these options readily accessible would make for a better customer experience and allow customers who’d prefer to use these channels a better chance to do so.</p>
<h2>6. Apple</h2>
<p>Apple co-founder Steve Jobs always had a great view of customer service and customer experience. In fact, he’s noted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>“You’ve got to start with the customer experience and work back toward the technology — not the other way around.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple seems to have taken that mantra to heart for their customer service, doing everything they can to help customers. Most products come with <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/complimentary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">90-day phone suppor</a>t, and there’s phone support numbers for almost<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">every country</a> you can think of. They’ve also got discussion forums, chat, and social media support. Interestingly enough, Apple doesn’t have a dedicated twitter account—rather, it has accounts for different branches like Apple Music, iTunes, AppStore, etc. When they do tweet with customers from subaccounts, they’re seen pointing customers in the right direction if they <a href="https://twitter.com/AppleMusicHelp/status/697954747437998080" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can’t find something</a>, and smartly shifting conversations to DM and other channels for more private conversations. They also share <a href="https://twitter.com/AppleMusicHelp/status/697872739764465664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">helpful content</a> before customers even have to ask.</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.icmi.com/~/media/Images/Resources/Articles/2016/01/Crushworthy6.ashx" alt="Apple customer service" width="590" height="364" /></div>
<p>The thing Apple is probably known for besides its sharply designed products is its in-store service at the Genius Bar, where Apple experts meet one on one with you to discuss how to set up or fix your device. Personally, every time I’ve gone in there I’ve received exemplary and knowledgeable service.</p>
<p><strong>What they can do to continue “crushing” customer service</strong>: As mentioned, one of Apple’s competitive differentiators is its Genius Bar. But the lack of a dedicated main Twitter support account for Apple is glaringly obvious. It’s their prerogative to add it or not, and their other subaccounts are doing a great job of providing support, but having a main social support channel, like 90% of big brands do, could fill a customer need. (Then again, not having a Twitter account sets them apart from the competition in yet another way).</p>
<h2>7. JetBlue</h2>
<p>Want to show that you’re committed to customers? Look no further than JetBlue and their <a href="http://www.jetblue.com/flying-on-jetblue/customer-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Customer Bill of Rights</a>. Here’s an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>JetBlue Airways is dedicated to bringing humanity back to air travel. We strive to make every part of your experience as simple and as pleasant as possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>JetBlue delivers human support across channels: they’ve got phone support, <a href="http://www.jetblue.com/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">email support</a>, a searchable knowledgebase, text updates, and a smartphone app. They make sure their service is human, especially on social, responding within minutes, <a href="https://twitter.com/JetBlue/status/698159338603548672" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointing customers</a> to pages that can help them, and responding with <a href="https://twitter.com/JetBlue/status/698048430808178688" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emojis and GIFs</a> to any questions customers might have. For instance: a customer jokingly tweeted that she wanted a parade when she got back, but the airport she was arriving at saw her tweet and <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/jetblue-customer-service-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">staged a little mini parade</a>. Talk about winning a fan for life!</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.icmi.com/~/media/Images/Resources/Articles/2016/01/Crushworthy7.ashx" alt="JetBlue customer experience" width="494" height="515" /></div>
<p>As mentioned in their Bill of Rights, they’re definitely not afraid to deliver personal service. Take, for instance, the time when a customer’s flight was delayed and it looked like she was going to miss her second flight. The manager <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JetBlue/posts/10152605978041843" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">booked her another flight</a> home that took off from another airport, and made the effort to drive her to another airport so she would make her flight on time. Or the time when a JetBlue employee in Salt Lake coordinated with employees in Boston to track down a customer who had missed his flight and <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/jetblue-customer-service-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brightened his day with a gift bag</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What they can do to continue “crushing” customer service</strong>: Just like Southwest, JetBlue absolutely crushes social and in-person service, so they should continue to focus on that. However, they’d also benefit from looking into alternative channels like SMS, which they’re already using for flight updates but could enhance quite a bit. Instead of just letting customers know their flight has been cancelled, why not let them text back to reschedule a flight? That’s just one way they can keep their customer service soaring.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Empowerment. That is the word that comes to mind when one considers how recent technological changes have affected a business’ ability to create compelling communication experiences. Despite the fact that the basic tools for making a phone call haven’t changed much in the last 150 years (even your smartphone still offers you a standard numeric keypad, not so different from the rotary phones of old), we are entering an age of innovation around communications such that the world has never seen before. And best of all, many of these technologies don’t require heavy-lifting from IT teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the monolithic incumbents in the enterprise communication space that require multi-million dollar upfront investments and multi-year deployment schedules, the future of communication lies in software. Developers are now able to leverage communication APIs to build proofs of concept in hours or days that they can share with their business partners. Similarly, business analysts can leverage drag-and-drop user interfaces to build communication solutions in minutes, without having to request development resources. Never before have both technical people and non-technical people had so much ability to create meaningful solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are real risks and process challenges to account for when trying to build your own communication solution. There are both technological and experiential conditions that you must account for.</span></p>
<h2><span id="more-7386"></span><b>Getting company-wide buy-in</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting company-wide buy-in is crucial for any project’s success, and it is not always easy to ascertain. One of the leading causes of project failure is lack of collaboration; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 85% of employees and executives cite lack of</span><a href="http://work.com/blog/2012/08/is-poor-collaboration-killing-your-company-infographic/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">collaboration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as leading to a project’s failure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Furthermore, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">75% of business and</span><a href="http://www.geneca.com/75-business-executives-anticipate-software-projects-fail/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">IT executives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> think their IT projects are doomed from the start, and project managers say executives ultimately determine what the fate of the project will be</span><a href="http://reports.informationweek.com/abstract/83/12175/IT-Business-Strategy/research-2014-enterprise-project-management-survey.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 63% of the time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, be it elimination or deferment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By taking a new approach (either building a POC on top of a communication API or a Software-as-a-Service application), the “go/no go” discussions will be far more productive. Think of it this way&#8211;in less time than it would take a business analyst to document requirements and engage with their technical counterparts to scope out level of effort, that same person could build a proof of concept and share a working example of a proposed solution to spark more productive conversations with the stakeholders. This makes it easier to achieve a shared vision and more buy-in.</span></p>
<h2><b>Lack of user experience expertise</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication solutions are usually customer facing, thus amplifying the risk associated with introducing a new experience. Creating an ‘on-brand’ customer experience is no small feat, and requires rapid cycles of design, build, test, repeat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaving experience design in the hands of a developer (or skipping the experience design process altogether) is risky; customers have expectations that you’ll likely want to meet and understand.  If they’re not trained in UX design, your developers may end up creating an experience that isn’t on brand and doesn’t improve the relationship with your customers. Furthermore, custom programming a solution may inhibit the ability to iterate rapidly and improve the experience over time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, building a text-messaging notification solution using a communication API provider is quite simple, but developers often neglect the fact that recipients will reply to those text messages and therefore don’t have any response strategy. In addition, if you develop your own solution, you will also have to build a user experience report in order to know where and how the solution can be improved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, using a SaaS application that has productized many features that protect the ability to iterate rapidly based on real data allows for the experience to be improved over time, and without having to request developer resources every time a change is requested. The pace of improvement is therefore instant.</span></p>
<h2><b>Cost of development and maintenance</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers love to build things, but they don’t enjoy the ongoing care and feeding that enterprise communication solutions require. And the ugly truth is that developing a custom solution, rather than configuring it through an existing software application, requires much more investment than you might think. Developing against third-party communication APIs removes nearly all of the complexity surrounding the complicated telephony network, but the normal software costs are still required, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Application monitoring</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infrastructure monitoring</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Load balancing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Database management</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quality assurance testing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infrastructure maintenance</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Benefits of using SaaS applications</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As outlined above, developing your own cloud communication solution can come with some big risks. However, creating it through a SaaS platform offers several key benefits:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b><b>Time to market. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you have a very clear vision for the ideal solution, it can take time to get your solution to where you want it to be and constant change requests burden the development team. With a hosted cloud communication solution, you can get any changes or updates deployed in no time.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Built-in features. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most cloud communication platforms will come with built-in features to eliminate the complexity of custom development. By productizing certain features, including integrations, users can leverage best practices and benefit from features that would otherwise be left in the ‘nice to have’ column and never be developed.. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Flexibility. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hosted cloud solutions come with a lot of flexibility, from custom design for communication flows to integrations to even custom skins that reflect your brand.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Built-in support team. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If something were to go wrong with your own solution, you’d have to devote your own resources to troubleshoot and fix it. With a hosted cloud communication solution, you have a dedicated support team on hand that will diagnose and correct any issues without you having to do a thing.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Business continuity. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of having to custom develop integrations with CRMs or other systems you might use, a hosted cloud solution will usually come with built-in integrations with the most popular CRMs. This way, you can ensure the right data is being passed between your cloud system and CRM. And if you’re using proprietary systems, it is easier to configure a custom integration than it is to develop one.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing your own cloud communication solution comes with inherent risks and pitfalls. By investing in an existing cloud platform, you’ll save money in the process and be able to provide your customers with a professional, well-designed customer experience.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s world, mobile customer service isn’t a luxury—it’s a necessity. In fact,</span><a href="http://www.icmi.com/About-ICMI/Press-Room/2013-Mobile-Customer-Service-Strategy-Results-Released"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">over 60% of businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> think mobile customer service is a competitive differentiator, and</span><a href="http://estebankolsky.com/2014/12/channel-adoption-and-usage-study-in-customer-service-third-year/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">over two-thirds of companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have “embraced” mobile as a customer service channel. In addition, the customer support <a href="http://www.softwareadvice.com/crm/customer-service-comparison/">tech research company</a> </span><a href="http://www.softwareadvice.com/crm/industryview/mobile-support-report-2015/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software Advice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has found that 60% of people use mobile for customer service fairly regularly.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-7351"></span><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2235 size-full" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/stats1.png" alt="text customer service" width="474" height="262" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what does mobile customer service really mean? Does it refer to a mobile app, texting, or a mobile website? At OneReach, we think businesses should offer customers the chance to text customer service, and we’ve got seven data-backed reasons why.</span></p>
<h2><b>1. 97% of U.S. smartphone owners use SMS, making it the most-used app on a smartphone.</b></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/#smartphones"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent report from Pew Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that the most-widely used an app on a smartphone isn’t an app at all—it’s SMS. Over 97% of users text, beating out voice (92%), Internet (89%), email (88%) and social networking site (75%). In addition, texting is also the most frequently used app on a smartphone, with users using it at least once a day.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2236 size-full" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/stats2.png" alt="text customer service2" width="425" height="215" /></p>

<p><b>How this relates to customer service:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Simply put, if you’re not investing money in the channels your customers are using most frequently, you’re missing out. Customers are engaging with one another on a variety of digital channels, and that’s only set to grow in the coming years (link). And while you may be allocating a certain chunk of your budget to social media customer service, you’ve got to consider the fact that, well…</span></p>
<h2><b>2. There are 500 million tweets sent each day, compared to 23 billion text messages.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research has found that</span><a href="http://www.internetlivestats.com/twitter-statistics/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">over half a billion tweets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are sent each day worldwide. While that’s a sizable amount, it’s only 1/46</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of daily global SMS traffic.</span><a href="http://www.portioresearch.com/en/blog/2013/17-incredible-facts-about-mobile-messaging-that-you-should-know.aspx"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Portio Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that people worldwide will send 8.3 trillion text messages in 2015, adding up to 23 billion per day, or nearly 16 million messages per minute.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2237" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/compare2.png" alt="text customer service3" width="461" height="19" /></p>
<p><b>How this relates to customer service: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re deciding where to allocate your customer service budget, make sure you don’t overlook texting. If people can send billions of messages a day to friends and family, it’s not so much of a stretch that they’d be willing to text your business. You’ve just got to give them the chance. There’s a pretty good chance they’ll take it because…</span></p>
<h2><b>3. Over 60% of customers would prefer to text your business.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research conducted by Harris Poll and commissioned by OneReach found that 81% of customers are frustrated being tied to a phone or computer for customer service. Luckily, there’s a way around that, as</span><a href="http://onereach.com/resources/high-demand-for-text-message-2014-report"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">64% of customers would rather text than call a business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2238 size-full" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/stats3.png" alt="text customer service4" width="366" height="214" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://onereach.com/resources/high-demand-for-text-message-2014-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">View the full Harris Poll report here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>How this relates to customer service: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional channels, while popular, aren’t necessarily the best channels in terms of customer satisfaction. That can be problematic,</span><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/2015/05/18/good-customer-service-tips-growing-loyal-customer-base"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">since 97% of customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who are satisfied with good service are “extremely” likely to refer a service to friends. However, there is one channel that’s proven to satisfy customers…</span></p>
<h2><b>4. Text is the highest rated channel in terms of customer satisfaction.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2012 contact center survey by</span><a href="http://www.cfigroup.com/downloads/CCSI_2012.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">CFI Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that texting was the highest rated contact method in terms of customer satisfaction. Texting earned 90 out of 100 points, while voice calls got 77 out of 100 and Facebook got 66.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2239 size-full" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/stats4.png" alt="text customer service5" width="561" height="290" /><a href="http://www.cfigroup.com/downloads/CCSI_2012.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">View the full report from CFI Group here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>How this relates to customer service: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a lot of reasons why texting could be preferred—it’s global, it’s flexible, it’s immediate, it’s engaging, it’s for everyone…the list goes on and on. Just think about the reasons you like to use texting—it lets you get in touch with people quickly and easily. In fact…</span></p>
<h2><b>5. Texting has a 98% open rate and a 45% response rate.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re trying to get in touch with people and get a quick answer, there’s no better channel to use than SMS. Most emails are lucky to get an open rate of 20%, but texting blows it out of the water with a</span><a href="http://velocify.com/blog/text-me-maybe-how-to-use-automated-text-messaging-to-win-love-leads-revenue/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">98% open rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Similarly, most emails see a 6% response rate, but texting has a monumental 45% response rate. And on top of all that,</span><a href="http://connectmogul.com/2013/03/texting-statistics/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">90% of texts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are answered in under three minutes.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2240 size-full" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/stats5.png" alt="text customer service6" width="481" height="170" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://velocify.com/blog/text-me-maybe-how-to-use-automated-text-messaging-to-win-love-leads-revenue/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">See the full infographic on Velocify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>How this relates to customer service: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the above statistics are for marketing, it’s not that much of a leap to see how they would apply to customer service. In fact, customers might be even more likely to open and respond to customer service texts, as they would be the ones to initiate the conversation. And speaking of conversations…</span></p>
<h2><b>6. Texting converts a $6-20 phone call into a chat that costs pennies per session.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research from Forrester has found that an average customer service call</span><a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/analystreports/enterprise-application/forrester-tei-atg-359304.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">can cost up to $20 per session</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  While phone will almost always be necessary for some customer service interactions, it’s not necessary for all of them. An SMS web chat session will only cost a company about $2-5, and automating a text conversation can lower the cost to as little as 25 cents per session.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2241 size-full" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/stats6.png" alt="text customer service7" width="276" height="330" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/analystreports/enterprise-application/forrester-tei-atg-359304.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">View the Forrester report here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>How this relates to customer service: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most companies view contact centers as cost centers, but it doesn’t have to be this way with text messaging. Some of our clients have seen 40% call deflection with text messaging, dramatically reducing operating costs by offering the option to</span><a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/channel-pivot-how-switching-from-voice-to-sms-benefits-everyone/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">channel pivot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to texting. In fact, more companies are offering texting…</span></p>
<h2><b>7. Nearly 40% of contact centers are already using texting, with plans to add more in the coming year.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research conducted by Dimension Data discovered that</span><a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">over 35% of contact centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer text messaging, with 23% plan to add it within the coming year. That means that over 60% of contact centers will offer SMS by 2017. And with over 35% of contact center interactions going digital, contact centers need to be ready to meet customers on channels other than phone.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2242 size-full" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/stats7.png" alt="text customer service8" width="392" height="203" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">View the summary Dimension Data report here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>How this relates to customer service: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers are communicating with businesses on more channels than ever before, and that includes text messaging. And while voice may remain the dominant channel for the foreseeable future, contact centers need to accommodate customers on alternative channels to provide them with the best customer experience possible.</span></p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Text messaging may have once been an alternative customer service channel, but more and more businesses are starting to recognize its potential. The question is, will you be one of them?</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Startups can be crazy, exciting places to work. While it can often feel like there are more balls in the air than hands to catch them, somehow everything ends up getting done. This is because, many times in startups, people from one department jump into another department to tackle the tasks at hand.</p>
<p>The collaborative, hands-on nature of startups is a great example of cross-functionality at work. <a href="http://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/crossfunctional">Cross-functional teams</a> combine the strengths and talents of different individuals to reach a common goal. Applied to customer service, cross-functional support means uniting individuals from several different departments (marketing, sales, operations, etc.) to figure out how to provide the best service possible to customers.</p>
<h2><span id="more-7343"></span><strong>How cross-functional support can benefit your company</strong></h2>
<p>Teamwork is an essential part of any startup or established company’s success, but working as a team to meet the needs of a customer is an entirely separate challenge. Cross-functional teams, however, are uniquely equipped to meet that challenge by using their respective skills to collaborate on a customer’s problem.</p>
<p>Venture capitalist <a href="http://tomtunguz.com/churn/">Tomasz Tunguz</a> sums up his thoughts on collaboration:</p>
<blockquote><p>The customer success team is on the front lines with customers passing feedback to product and marketing. Customer success provides a check on the sales team, ensuring the right customers are prioritized and closed.</p></blockquote>
<p>The best way to understand a product is to use it, so what better way for marketers to learn what prospects want than to provide customer support for that product every once in awhile? The same goes for product teams, executives, etc.</p>
<p>Cross-functionality also allows companies to create more personal, customer-centric interactions thanks to multi-departmental insight. Take what Kleiner Perkins partners Ted Schlein and Creighton Hicks recently said about <a href="http://www.kpcb.com/blog/the-magic-of-customer-empathy">customer centricity</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Understanding how users interact with your product is essential to successful product development. It benefits not only design and production, but also marketing, selling and support.</p></blockquote>
<p>This type of collaboration also enables team members to learn new skills and create useful customer service content across departments. For example, if a cross-functional meeting determines that customers have been having trouble using a new product, marketing can create product-specific collateral that sales can later use. Operations can also check in to make sure the new product is working correctly. A combined knowledge of the customer means each department can do their job better. They can also pool resources from across departments (equipment, personnel, etc.) to meet the task at hand.</p>
<p>Cross-functional support can also boost company creativity and allow different departments to bond over a shared purpose – customer success. Each team member can bring their respective strengths and insights to the group to figure out how to improve the customer experience and address problems quickly and efficiently. This also creates a sense of synergy that may not have been there before. Employees from different departments can work together to identify service problems or opportunities that might not have been apparent had the employees not worked together. Once this collaborative group has been established, they can continue innovating and sharing to drive customer service change.</p>
<h2><strong>Using collaboration to optimize and enhance the customer journey</strong></h2>
<p>By collaborating to solve problems encountered throughout the entire customer journey, companies can create more targeted support for each stage. In turn, these hyper-focused interactions will create loyalty, as venture capitalist <a href="http://www.bvp.com/blog/customer-loyalty-magic">Ethan Kurzweil</a> has said. In fact, research has shown that <a href="http://www.thewisemarketer.com/briefs/archive.asp?action=read&amp;bid=4489">over 90% of customers</a> who have an effortless service experience with companies will buy from that company again.</p>
<p>Cross-functional teams can create user personas to identify pain points and probable actions taken throughout their journey, then decide what needs must be addressed. That’s because as the customer passes through each stage of the customer journey, each department has hands-on experience assessing their wants and needs and can pass those insights along to the larger team. When cross-functional teams do come together to reach a goal (in this case providing better service), they combine their knowledge to create a cohesive customer service plan.</p>
<p>Cross-functional support is a great way for each department to get firsthand customer feedback as well as offer exceptional customer service experiences. By prioritizing customer success, companies of all size can benefit from loyal customers and well-rounded teams.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.parature.com/10-gartner360-takeaways/">According to a recent Gartner report</a>, “by 2015, at least 60% of Internet users will opt for mobile customer service applications as their first option.” This is a significant shift that brings with it enormous challenges and opportunities. Companies and brands that honor this &#8220;mobile first&#8221; preference must understand the intimate relationship that people have with their mobile device, and how their brand experience on these devices will shape the relationship they are building with each individual.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7208"></span>It is also important to understand how people are currently using their mobile phones, and to extend existing behavioral patterns into the new context of SMS customer support. For example, despite the popularity of email, social networks, and web browsing on mobile devices, text messaging is by far <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/09/19/cell-phone-activities-2013/">the most common activity</a> people do on their phone with 81% of American adults texting. Texting is even more popular than phone calls: on average, people receive and recieve <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2011/Americans and Text Messaging.pdf">42 texts a day</a>, compared to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2276752/Mobile-users-leave-phone-minutes-check-150-times-day.html">six calls</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The natural conclusion would be that if most people want SMS customer support on their mobile device, and texting is the most common activity on a mobile device, then offering text-based support makes perfect sense. A study conducted by Harris Poll and commissioned by OneReach found that <a href="http://onereachcontactcenter.com/high-demand-for-customer-service-via-text-message/">64% of customers</a> who text would rather text than call for customer service. However, crafting a SMS customer support strategy requires some background knowledge.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What Customers Expect From Text</h2>
<p dir="ltr">To implement a text support strategy, businesses have to consider what the implied promises are of SMS as a channel. For example, most people who text are usually doing so with someone they have a relationship with. Whether it’s friends, family members, or co-workers, people tend to text with those that are close to them. This means that they expect to get a reply, or to offer one. In other words, it is very conversational.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=343">Grammar and spelling rules may not always apply</a>, but people expect some sort of indication that you got their message. Even a simple “ok” will suffice. Still, the second someone doesn’t reply to a text, people natural to assume that either something went wrong, or that they&#8217;re are being ignored. In either case, it has a negative connotation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So how does this impact SMS as a viable customer service channel? Simple- companies that prioritize customer experience should commit to the fact that people are used to texting with other people and let them text directly with one of your employees/agents. Simply put&#8211;<a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=571">text support is a two-way street</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another way to show that you understand your customers&#8217; preferences and the implied promises of this channel is to allow the them to initiate a text message to your business the same way they are used to doing it with friends and family- to a number already saved in their contact list. Once customers know they can <a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/channel-pivot-how-switching-from-voice-to-sms-benefits-everyone/">call or text you on the same number</a> (even your existing toll-free number), they will be more likely to save that number in their phone. Then, when they do receive a text from you, it won’t be coming from an unknown number, or worse yet some weird looking 5-digit short code.</p>
<h2>How To Implement a SMS Customer Support Strategy</h2>
<p dir="ltr">How can businesses manage the inbound text messages they receive? Step one is to answer them, of course. However, this isn&#8217;t just with a robot (though a sophisticated ITR- Interactive Text Response- system can be used to effectively allow for appropriate levels of self-service and pre-chat data collection for routing purposes). The companies who are truly committing to offering a delightful customer experience will answer each inbound text message with a response from a real person.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Contact center managers are realizing that companies like <a href="onereach.com">OneReach</a> can make it so their existing web-chat clients serve as the agent interface for these text-to-chat conversations. The curve ball is that even though text-to-chat sessions <a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=273">are far more affordable</a> than phone conversations, the number of interactions may go up due to the fact that you have made it so easy for your customers to contact you. The way to control costs, then, is through smart automation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Picture this&#8211;a customer initiates a text conversation and asks for help with resetting their password. That request is responded to by a real person, who then sends the customer into an automated interaction that walks the customer through the process step by step. Even better, at each step the automation engine uses relevant information pulled form a CRM product to personalize the interaction. So really, it’s personal interaction blended with personalized automation. The result is a satisfied customer and a less expensive SMS support experience.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Companies generally provide tech support through phone or email, so when some companies began providing it through text messages, there was some anxiety. According to <a href="http://www.practicalecommerce.com/articles/4139-Text-Messaging-Effective-for-Retailers-">practicalecommerce.com</a>, there are 4.3 billion people carrying SMS-enabled devices, and of those, 96% send text messages on a regular basis. Those who have used text-based tech support as opposed to the phone-based alternative typically prefer texting. <a href="http://onereachcontactcenter.com/high-demand-for-customer-service-via-text-message/">A Harris Poll study</a> found that 64% of customers who text prefer SMS to phone for customer service.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7207"></span>A lot of this has to do with the fact that customers can receive support in a loud or crowded place and not worry about being able to hear their technician. A technician can help multiple people at once through this particular type of support using a text chat interface. It would be impossible for one agent to simultaneously help out more than one customer over the phone at the same time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Due to increasingly complex products and services being offered to consumers, tech support demand is only increasing. The quality of tech support being delivered by text has become so advanced that it is possible to gradually evaluate the issue the customer in question is attempting to address. A few simple questions being answered by the customer will allow the tech support professional to determine what sort of issue they are having and how they might go about solving it. With the necessary information in hand, a tech support professional can then begin to thoroughly research the issue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Customers submitting information via <a href="http://www.onereach.com/">text</a> as opposed to over the phone is a much more expedient option, freeing up more time for technicians and increasing productivity. With the existing technology that is out there, it is possible to navigate through a tech support system via texting very quickly. A tiered or tree system will allow a consumer to navigate the system and provide information about their problem quickly, making it both faster and simpler for the technician to address the customer&#8217;s questions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The cost of implementing this customer service option could involve the use of additional technology at the workplace, but the learning curve therein will be vastly outdone by the expedience and accuracy of support being delivered. During the initial phase of creating a text-based tech support system, it is important to still allow customers to call in. This wa,y they can still receive support the way they are used to. It is also worth considering that the average response time to an email is 90 minutes, while the average response time to a text message is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyV7ll85MqU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=36s">90 seconds</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As customers become aware of this new system and try it out, they will use it more than the traditional alternative (phone). By providing tech support over text messaging, companies will be able to get customers the help they need on a channel they use, and all in a time frame that works for them.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Having a “mobile strategy” goes beyond just having a mobile application and mobile friendly website. It means using all of the capabilities of today’s mobile phones and understanding the role that these devices play in the lives of your customers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">How much of a role? Not to get too personal,<a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/233230"> but more people would rather give up sex than give up their phone</a>. A study found that 26% of Americans said they couldn’t live without their smartphone, while only 20% of Americans said they couldn’t live without sex. The same study found that 44% of people sleep with their phone at night, and 67% check their phone even if it’s not ringing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7173"></span>With such a close connection to our mobile phones, it’s no surprise that we use them for anything and everything: checking bank accounts, ordering food, getting customer service help, etc. A lot of apps provide this service, but it isn’t always enough.<a href="http://onereachcontactcenter.com/high-demand-for-customer-service-via-text-message/"> According to a study</a> conducted by Harris Interactive and commissioned by OneReach, over 60% of consumers would prefer to use text for customer service, (and most are frustrated with today’s typical service channels like phone and email).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Customers don’t think in terms of channel when they’re trying to get support&#8211;they are looking for an experience that requires the least amount of effort. This means that downloading yet another app isn’t always an appealing option. Think about how much easier it would be to manage banking, shipments and dinner reservations over SMS, instead of downloading a different app for each separate need.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s not hard to see why consumers want to the ability to text a support line, given that <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/mobile-technology-fact-sheet/">SMS is the most used app on a mobile device</a>. However, it’s important to understand how using this channel can support a more broad mobile strategy. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using SMS to deliver a link to your mobile app can improve install rates.</strong> The average person checks their phone<a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.slicktext.com/blog/2014/02/text-message-marketing-the-new-kid-on-the-block-infographic/"> within five seconds</a> of receiving a text message. Sending your users a link to download the app means there’s a higher chance of them actually doing what you want them to do.</li>
<li><strong>Allowing customers to text your contact center can reduce costs and improve customer satisfaction.</strong> The average contact center phone call <a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=273">costs between $6-20</a>; in contrast, two-way text chat costs only $2-5, a price that can be reduced even more with automation. Additionally,<a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.cfigroup.com/downloads/CCSI_2012.pdf"> a study by CFI Group</a> showed that SMS had the highest satisfaction score of any channel.</li>
<li><strong>Using SMS for proactive notifications can reduce the amount of inbound call volume and improve customer satisfaction.</strong> For organizations like a doctor’s office, this technology is essential; instead of having 10 patients call to schedule their next appointment, a personalized, automated text could be sent out to schedule a future appointment.</li>
<li><strong>Using SMS to transition social interactions (particularly negative ones) to a more private channel is a great way to manage your reputation.</strong> It can be a business’ nightmare when a customer shares their complaints on social media for every to see. One alternative is to have the support agent tweet back a number that the customer could text, transitioning the conversation from public to private, decreasing the chance for public fallout.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Text is powerful on its own, but when it works with other channels, it’s unstoppable.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If your company is one of the many now opting to provide tech support through text, you may be anxious about implementing this new technology. There is good news, however. First of all, integrating text is likely way more simple and straightforward than you think (as you can read about <a href="http://onereachcontactcenter.com/sms/">here</a>). Secondly, the benefits of switching to text-based tech support vastly outweigh the risk of lagging behind in an outdated voice-only system. Here are a few that come to mind.</p>
<h2><span id="more-7106"></span><b>Preference</b></h2>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.practicalecommerce.com/articles/4139-Text-Messaging-Effective-for-Retailers-">practicalecommerce.com</a> there are 4.3 billion people carrying SMS-enabled devices, and of those 96 percent send text messages on a regular basis. In fact, text messaging is the most common activity done on mobile devices (Source: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/KarlPortio/mobile-data-usage-trends-20112015">Portio Research</a>). Plus, those who have used text-based tech support as opposed to the phone-based alternative typically prefer texting.</p>
<h2><b>Privacy</b></h2>
<p>Customers love the fact that they can receive support in a loud or crowded place through texting and not worry about trying to hear the representative. And it makes sense. Who really wants to embarrass themselves in public as they yell “help” repeatedly at an unresponsive IVR? Plus, when people do business while on the move, they often balk at audibly giving or receiving private information. They may not want those around them to hear what they are ordering, what trouble they are having, or what financial changes they would like to make.</p>
<h2><b>Quality</b></h2>
<p>Tech support demand is only increasing as more complex products and services are being offered to consumers. Texting allows a tech support professional to provide a quality experience for the customer by easily and accurately evaluating, troubleshooting, and solving a customer’s issue. With the necessary information in hand, a tech support professional can either solve the problem in the moment or take a few minutes for more thorough research.</p>
<h2><b>Efficiency</b></h2>
<p>It is more efficient for customers to use <a href="http://onereachcontactcenter.com/sms/">text</a> rather than phone, freeing up more time for customer service representatives and increasing productivity. Existing technology allows customers to navigate through a tech support system via texting very quickly. A tiered or tree system will help customers provide information about their problem, making the process both faster and simpler for the technician and customer alike. Plus, a technician can help multiple people at once through this type of support, while it would be impossible to help out more than one customer over the phone at the same time.</p>
<h2><b>Cost</b></h2>
<p>Yes, there might be some initial cost when switching to text due to technology upgrades and training. However, the learning curve will be vastly overshadowed by the timeliness and accuracy of support being delivered. Keep in mind that during the initial phase of creating a text-based tech support system it is important to still allow customers to call in so they can still receive support the way they are used to. As customers become aware of the new system and try it they will undoubtedly use it more than the traditional alternative. It is also worth considering that the average response time to an email is 90 minutes, while the average response time to a text message is 90 seconds according to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyV7ll85MqU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=36s">Responsive Presence.</a> Which seems more cost effective to you?</p>
