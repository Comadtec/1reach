								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy Friday! Here’s our picks for the best customer service, customer experience, bot and mobile articles of the week, in no particular order.</p>
<h2><span id="more-7440"></span></h2>
<h2><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/enriquedans/2016/07/13/right-now-artificial-intelligence-is-the-only-thing-that-matters-look-around-you/#6f20d34b2480">Right Now, Artificial Intelligence is the Only Thing That Matters</a>&#8211; <a href="http://@edans">by Enrique Dans</a></h2>
<p>Machine learning and artificial intelligence are the keys to almost every aspect of life in the very near future: every sector, every business. Read on to find out how to integrate artificial intelligence for smarter business communication.</p>
<h2><a href="http://digiday.com/brands/two-months-1-800-flowers-facebook-bot-working/">Two Months in: How the 1-800 Flowers Facebook Bot is Working Out</a>&#8211; <a href="http://@digiday">by Grace Caffyn</a></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">You&#8217;ve heard all the hype around bots, but just exactly how are bots doing? According to this article, most customers, mainly millennials prefer to interact with a robot rather than a human. Surprisingly, </span><span style="font-size: medium;">the people using this bot are attracting younger audience. </span></p>
<h2><a href="http://www.mycustomer.com/community/blogs/denispombriant/the-four-attributes-of-customer-loyalty-the-role-of-automation-in">The Four Attributes of Customer Loyalty</a> &#8211;<a href="http://@DenisPombriant">by Denis Prombriant </a></h2>
<p>This is the first of four articles, discussing a trait that makes up the best customer loyalty. The first major attribute- AUTOMATION. At OneReach we believe automation is key, whether for creating  bots or enabling logic based routing. Automation&#8217;s purpose is to trim down on labor and maximize the role of the resources companies invest.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/shephyken/2016/07/09/whats-hot-in-customer-service-and-whats-not/#1b3f5f66601a">What&#8217;s Hot in Customer Service&#8211;And What&#8217;s Not</a>&#8211;<a href="http://@Hyken">by Shep Hyken </a></h2>
<p>With the phone starting to take a back seat for communication regarding issues or questions, self-service is, and will, continue to grow in the future. As technology improves for automated assistants, customers are becoming more comfortable to not have to interact with an actual human being.</p>

<h2><span id="more-7439"></span></h2>
<h2><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/03/what-businesses-need-to-understand-about-chatbots/?ncid=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29&amp;sr_share=facebook">What Businesses Need to Understand about Chatbots</a>&#8211; by <a href="http://@LirazMargalit">Liraz Margalit </a></h2>
<p>You have been slammed with the topic of bots and the details of them, but why do businesses need to understand them? Bots have the potential to provide greater conveniences than apps because they can understand &#8220;natural speech patterns and provide the personal touch in an impersonal user interface.&#8221; If understood and utilized correctly, chatbots have the power to help business grow in many ways.</p>
<h2><a href="http://customerthink.com/the-power-of-personal-brands-in-customer-service/">The Power of Personal Brands in Customer Service</a>&#8211; by <a href="http://@LarryAlton3">Larry Alton </a></h2>
<p>Most businesses have implemented the use of social media as a way to interact with customers, however, there’s an additional source of reach and power that many firms aren’t aware of, so it largely remains untapped: personal brands. Read more to identify the advantages and potentially improve your customer strategy.</p>

<p>Read more to find out how artificial intelligence is gaining big wins in the digital marketing space and why you should be concerned if you&#8217;re on the side lines.</p>

<p>The experience a customer has with a company will, more times than not, determine if that customer returns to the brand or takes their business elsewhere. Providing great experiences for your customers doesn&#8217;t end with your front line, it&#8217;s the entire company&#8217;s responsibility. See how every department within a company can (and should) get involved.</p>

<h2><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;"><a href="http://onereach.com/blog/why-digital-customer-service-must-balance-automation-human-connection/">Why Digital Service Must Balance Automation and Human Connection</a>&#8211;</span> by Stephan Delbos </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Here at OneReach we love automation, especially in ways we can help make life easier on customers. However, we understand there needs to be a balance between technology and humanization. Check out this article, guest written for our blog about finding a happy medium. </span></p>

<p>Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication. What if we said Apple is giving developers access to your messages?</p>

<p>People download and try out new apps all the time, but nobody wants to have 100&#8217;s of apps on their phone. 77% of app users delete an app within the first 3 days, 90% leave within 30 days, and 1 in 4 people abandon an app only after one use.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy Friday! Here’s our picks for the best customer service, customer experience, bot and mobile articles of the week, in no particular order.</p>
<h2><span id="more-7424"></span><strong><a href="http://www.mycustomer.com/service/contact-centres/sheps-blog-why-self-service-still-needs-human-support-for-success">Why Self-Service Still Needs Human Support for Success</a> by <a href="http://hyken.com/">Shep Hyken</a></strong></h2>
<p>At OneReach, we’re big fans of self-service via voice and text message, but despite our love for automation, we know customer service still sometimes needs a human touch. Machines won’t always have the answer to complex questions, and they won’t be able to recognize when a customer needs help based off their emotions. Customer service expert Shep Hyken understands this, and in his MyCustomer post, recounts a few instances where getting help from a human was just what the situation needed to get a customer from struggle to success.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/270814">5 Reasons to Reimagine How You Offer Customer Support</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/LeylaSeka">Leyla Seka</a></strong></h2>
<p>Customer service has evolved a lot in the past few decades. Support interactions used to be limited to just a phone call, but now customers can reach a company over email, social media and even text message. And as channel offerings have expanded, customers now expect to reach a company anytime, anywhere. So how can companies provide service when customers need it? As Desk GM Leyla Seka explains, one of the best ways is to incorporate a support center into your website and product. That way, customers can get the help they need when they need it.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2016/04/20/3-reasons-facebook-chatbots-are-good-for-customer-service/#3f407f125f98">3 Reasons Facebook Chatbots Are Good For Customer Service</a> by <a href="http://www.blakemichellemorgan.com/">Blake Morgan</a></strong></h2>
<p>If you’ve been paying attention to the goings-on of a lot of big tech brands lately, you’ll know that chatbots are all the rage. Facebook and Kik just rolled out bot stores where companies can design their own bots, and several organizations like Spring and CNN are already using them to interact with customers and readers. But can chatbots really provide great customer service? According to customer experience expert Blake Morgan, yes they can. One of the reasons they’re great for customer service, she says, is because they automate responses to common questions.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://www.cx-journey.com/2016/04/top-10-cx-challenges-for-2016.html">The Top 10 CX Challenges for 2016</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/annettefranz">Annette Franz</a></strong></h2>
<p>Over 80% of companies say they want to differentiate on superior service and customer experience, but unfortunately, only 8% of customers think they’re actually doing that. Part of the reason could be because companies don’t have a customer-centric culture. As customer experience expert Annette Franz outlines in a recent blog post, not having a customer-centric culture really comes down to commitment issues. Companies need to have an investment in customer success if they want to provide the experiences customers are after.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy Friday! Here’s our picks for the best customer service, customer experience, bot and mobile articles of the week, in no particular order.</p>
<h2><span id="more-7419"></span><strong><a href="http://customerthink.com/employees-vs-robots-who-is-better-at-service/">Employees vs. Robots: Who Is Better At Service?</a> by <a href="http://www.toistersolutions.com/">Jeff Toister</a></strong></h2>
<p>At OneReach, we’re big believers in the fact that automated customer service, or bot-mediated customer service, can make for a better customer experience. It’s quicker, easy to use, and most times will be able to get you the answer for a simple question. But as customer service expert Jeff Toister points out in his CustomerThink post, while robots may have a vast database of knowledge backing them, they might have trouble making a human connection with customers. However, he does acknowledge bots’ strength in solving simple customer services inquiries, but explains that complex interactions are still best in the hands of a human.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://blog.capterra.com/6-unexpected-places-to-find-customer-service-resources-online/">6 Unexpected Places to Find Customer Service Resources Online</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/capterralegal">Cathy Reisenwitz</a></strong></h2>
<p>I’m always interested in learning more about customer service and customer experience, and I have a few go-to sites I visit—<a href="http://mycustomer.com/">MyCustomer</a>, <a href="http://customerthink.com/">CustomerThink</a>, <a href="http://icmi.com/">ICMI</a>, <a href="http://brandembassy.com/">Brand Embassy</a>, etc. But it turns out there are some unexpected places to find customer service wisdom on the Internet. In her article for Capterra Service, Cathy Reisenwitz explains that sites like Buzzfeed are a great source of customer service inspiration. As Reisenwitz points out, the site does a great job of highlighting <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/tamerragriffin/a-playstation-employee-customized-a-controller-for-a-gamer-w#.bjP1kYgZa">customer service stories</a>, and even somehow makes the relationship between <a href="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8sq4rwGOM1ry883to1_500.gif">cat GIFs and good customer service</a>.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://www.brandembassy.com/blog/why-chatbots-will-not-replace-contact-centers">Why Chatbots Will NOT Replace the Contact Center</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/vithorky">Vit Horky</a> </strong></h2>
<p>Chatbots are becoming increasingly prevalent, so much so that Facebook Messenger and Kik, two of the world’s largest messaging platforms, are rolling out their own bot stores. This means that it will be easier than ever for businesses to add automated communications to their business, or design their own bot. But when it comes to customer service, will bots reign supreme? Brand Embassy CEO Vit Horky thinks not, namely because bots can’t empathize and are only as good as their existing knowledge base. Much like Jeff Toister, though, he admits that bots are good for simple, straightforward interactions, while humans should still be involved in more complex, emotional conversations.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://www.convinceandconvert.com/customer-experience/23-statistics-that-show-why-customer-service-mostly-sucks/">23 Statistics That Show Why Customer Service Mostly Sucks</a> by <a href="http://www.jaybaer.com/">Jay Baer</a> </strong></h2>
<p>Every business likes to think they provide great customer service, but the reality is that there’s a huge disconnect between brands and consumers. Research shows that while 80% of businesses think they provide great customer service, only 8% of consumers agree. And those aren’t the only statistics out there about poor customer service. In his Convince &amp; Convert post, content marketing expert Jay Baer outlines the various frsutations customers have with customer service, ranging from slow response times to unanswered complaints to the decision not to make a purchase.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy Friday! Here’s our picks for the best customer service, customer experience and mobile articles of the week, in no particular order.</p>
<h2><span id="more-7412"></span><strong><a href="mailto:http://www.business2community.com/customer-experience/ode-canned-responses-channel-resolution-01495023%239T4BU35Q4cSJykAh.97">Ode to Canned Responses and Out-of-Channel Resolution</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/tamarush">Tamar Frumkin</a></strong></h2>
<p>Being bounced from channel to channel without any resolution makes for a bad customer experience. What makes it worse is having to start your conversation all over again. Perhaps that’s why over 85% of customers today demand an omnichannel experience from businesses. Unfortunately, some companies aren’t delivering on that expectation. In her article for Business 2 Community, marketing expert Tamar Frumkin explains her understandable frustration with one fitness clothing company’s customer experience, sending her from channel to channel without ever getting a decent response. Here’s hoping that that company learns to resolve issues within the channel they’re contacted on, or at least track the interactions across channels so customers don’t have to start over.</p>

<p>There are some companies that you just associate with the phrase “good customer service”: Amazon, Nordstrom, L.L. Bean, etc. They’re willing to go above and beyond for their customers, whether they’re offering free shipping, exclusive member perks, or just a great ambiance. In addition, as consumer analyst Pam Goodfellow points out in her list of top 10 brands, business don’t necessarily need to have a physical storefront to provide a great experience for customers.</p>

<p>In the digital world, it can be a little trickier to provide customers with a great, personalized experience. There’s no one there to greet you at the door or make friendly conversation as they scan your items. There’s also no one there that remembers the last time you came in and what you purchased. That’s where omnichannel service comes in. As Brand Embassy’s Carly Burdova points out in her excellent blog post, by continuing a conversation you’ve already started with a customer (ie their purchase history or Twitter interactions), you can build a relationship with them. Maybe it’s not so tricky after all.</p>

<p>When customers contact you, they don’t think about the fact that different channels are often managed by different departments. To them, your business is one unified entity—whatever channel they contact you on, they should be able to get the help they need. But as Nicola Millard points out in her MyCustomer post, businesses often think in terms of silos and don’t realize the impact this has on the customer experience. To get around this, she recommends making sure channels are integrated, all while letting customers choose what information they let companies have access to.</p>

<h2><span id="more-7407"></span><strong><a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/271906">5 Easy Ways to Improve Client Retention</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/jaysondemers">Jayson DeMers</a></strong></h2>
<p>Every company needs to gain and retain customers to be successful, but gaining new customers is far more costly for your business. In fact, it costs <a href="http://www.spoken.com/blog/2010/10/cost-of-acquiring-a-new-customer-6-to-7-times-more-than-keeping-exisiting.html">6-7 times more</a> to attract a new customer than keep an existing one. So how can you make sure you keep customers around, the ones that will ultimately end up driving <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexlawrence/2012/11/01/five-customer-retention-tips-for-entrepreneurs/#f43bcca17b0b">80% of future revenue</a>? According to AudienceBloom founder and CEO Jayson DeMers, one of the best ways to retain customers is to communicate constantly. Communicate about the good and the bad, but make sure you’re keeping in touch through it all.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://www.mycustomer.com/community/blogs/akinde-hafiz/5-extremely-costly-customer-service-mistakes-to-avoid">5 Extremely Costly Customer Service Mistakes to Avoid</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/akinde_hafiz">Akinde Hafiz</a></strong></h2>
<p>There are a variety of ways bad customer service can lose you a customer—the agent wasn’t able to help with their problem, the issue was never resolved, one (or both) parties lost their temper, etc. But scenarios like this can be avoided, if you know what to avoid. One of the customer service mistakes you should avoid is using incompetent personnel, according to customer relations manager Akinde Hafiz. You can avoid this by making sure staff are properly trained and have the soft and hard skills needed to provide great customer service.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://customerthink.com/customer-experience-boggle-busters-for-channel-silos/">Customer Experience Boggle Busters for Channel Silos</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/clearaction">Lynn Hunsaker</a></strong></h2>
<p>At OneReach, we’ve long talked about the benefits of omnichannel—customers are seamlessly transferred across channels without losing track of where they were in the conversation. And customers want to have omnichannel experiences—research from Zendesk has found that <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/resources/omnichannel-customer-service-report/">87% of customers</a> thinks brands could do a better job of providing seamless experiences. In her CustomerThink article, CX expert Lynn Hunsaker explains that in order to provide a consistent experience, companies need to collaborate across departments. This is essential when adding a new operations, sales, marketing or service channel.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/micahsolomon/2016/03/13/what-eating-chocolate-can-teach-you-about-customer-service-and-building-a-great-customer-experience/#3c8c70c16084">What Eating Chocolate Can Teach You About Customer Service And Building A Great Customer Experience</a> by <a href="http://www.micahsolomon.com/">Micah Solomon</a></strong></h2>
<p>Customer service typically involves just two parties: the company and the customer. Occasionally another agent will get involved if a problem gets escalated or another person who works with the customer will jump on the call, but for the most part it’s a one-on-one experience. But what if involving multiple parties in an interaction improved the experience? As customer service expert Micah Solomon explains, it can: “When your business facilitates connection between your customer and the people your customer cares most about, you’re providing a powerful and long-lasting reason for that customer to keep doing business with you.”</p>

<h2><span id="more-7395"></span><strong><a href="http://blog.kayako.com/how-to-stop-your-customers-from-leaving-you">How to Stop Your Customers from Leaving You</a> by <a href="http://customerthermometer.com/">Mark Copeman</a></strong></h2>
<p>It’s a fact of life—customers leave. There are any number of reasons why: they may decide not to renew their account because they can’t afford it, or they might stop using your product because it’s no longer the right fit. But what if there were some things you could do to encourage customers to stay for the long haul? It turns out there are a few strategies. In his guest blog post for Kayako, Customer Thermometer co-founder Mark Copeman details several different ways your company can keep customers and encourage loyalty. One of those ways is to make a customer, not a sale. Sales reps should focus on signing up a customer that will last for a lifetime, not just stay to hit their quota. Bringing a customer in and having them realize your product isn’t what they really need makes for a bad customer experience.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://www.business.com/product-management/5-customer-service-skills-every-employee-must-have/">5 Customer Service Skills Every Employee Must Have</a> by <a href="http://www.hissingkitty.com/">Christine James</a></strong></h2>
<p>It’s easy to relegate customer service to just one department, leaving service reps as the only ones with a working knowledge of your product and how to help customers when things get difficult. But not having an organization-wide focus on great service won’t work in today’s world. Customers interact with your business in more ways than ever before, meaning everyone in your organization needs to be ready to help should any questions arise. In her article for Business.com, Christine James describes five skills every employee needs to have. One of those is critical thinking skills—employees need to be able to think on their feet and tackle any problem that comes their way. This helps ensure that the customer gets the help they need, regardless of who they talk to.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://customerthink.com/a-practical-guide-to-connecting-with-customers/">A Practical Guide to Connecting with Customers</a> by <a href="http://gofcr.com/">Jeremy Watkin</a></strong></h2>
<p>Every business wants to have a close connection with their customers, and a lot of the time, that connection will take place during customer service interactions. Unfortunately, while <a href="http://www.helpscout.net/75-customer-service-facts-quotes-statistics/">80% of companies</a> boast that they provide customers with “superior” customer service, less than 10% of customers actually agree. That begs the question—what steps can you take in your customer service to ensure that you’re actually connecting with customers? In his CustomerThink article, customer service expert Jeremy Watkin explains that one method is to start and end the conversation the right way. Greeting a customer with a friendly “Hello” can go a long way in fostering a connection with your brand.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://www.icmi.com/Resources/Strategy-and-Planning/2016/02/How-Do-You-Define-Outstanding-Customer-Service">How Do You Define Outstanding Customer Service?</a> by <a href="http://www.toistersolutions.com/">Jeff Toister</a></strong></h2>
<p>How do you define good customer service? Is it because wait times are short? Is it because you get your question answered on the first try? Is it because representatives are friendly and knowledgeable? The answer is that it probably depends, because each person has their own definition what makes for good customer service. So, in turn, do businesses. In his ICMI article, customer service expert Jeff Toister explains that businesses like REI and In-N-Out set different service standards for themselves, and that’s okay. As Toister says, your business needs to find a definition that works for you.</p>

<h2><span id="more-7392"></span><strong><a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-average-american-will-spend-43-days-of-his-life-on-hold-2016-02-04">The American Will Spend 43 Days of His Life Waiting on Hold</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/cateyhill">Catey Hill</a></strong></h2>
<p>Let’s come right out and say it—waiting on hold sucks. You have other things to do and places to be, all of which you can’t do because you’re stuck waiting to talk to an agent or getting frustrated with endless options. It’s not a fun prospect, something mobile advertising analytics firm Marchex knows all too well. In her recent article for MarketWatch, Catey Hill outlines key Marchex findings, which include the fact that Americans will spend almost one <em>billion </em>minutes waiting on hold this year. In addition, waiting on hold is one of consumers’ top three pet peeves with their phone experience.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/micahsolomon/2016/02/07/customer-service-experts-vote-whats-the-most-offensive-thing-you-can-say-to-a-customer/#32cb7efd78cb">The Most Offensive Customer Service Phrases</a> by <a href="http://micahsolomon.com/">Micah Solomon</a></strong></h2>
<p>Words carry a lot of weight in casual conversations, but perhaps nowhere are they more important than in customer service interactions. The words you use and the tone you take with customers can end up impacting the experience for better or worse. That’s why customer service expert and writer Micah Solomon consulted other experts to see what they considered an egregious word choice. One of the worst offenders? Calling anyone “young lady” or using terms of endearment like “Honey,” which can come across as patronizing to the customer.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://www.business.com/customer-service/what-drives-successful-customer-satisfaction">What Drives Successful Customer Satisfaction?</a>  by <a href="https://twitter.com/insurancesite">Justin R. Brown</a></strong></h2>
<p>There are multiple ways to track customer satisfaction (CSAT, NPS, CES, etc.), but how do you actually go about making sure customers are satisfied? What steps can you take to make sure that customers are happy with your brand and will turn into repeat, loyal customers? In his Business.com article, Justin R. Brown explains several different tactics you can take, one of which is to be proactive. By anticipating customer needs before they even start (Brown uses the examples of airlines sending flight delay notifications), you can provide a great experience that will leave customers feeling satisfied with your service.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://customerthink.com/5-ways-to-show-contact-center-agents-love/">5 Ways to Show Contact Center Agents Love</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/beyondmorale">Jim Rembach</a></strong></h2>
<p>A lot of thought is given to how to improve the customer experience, but how often do we ever focus on the employee experience? It should definitely be more often. In fact, our customer service influencers report last year found that the number one way to improve customer service was to focus on the employee experience. Contact center expert Jim Rembach agrees, and points out that there are a few ways to motivate your employees. One way is to hire for love by finding candidates who really care about the rest of the team as well as the customers.</p>
