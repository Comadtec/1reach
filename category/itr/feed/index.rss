								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July of 2013 Toby Shapshak, the South African speaker, strategist and editor of Stuff Magazine, did a TED talk called </span><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/toby_shapshak_you_don_t_need_an_app_for_that?language=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You Don’t Need An App For That</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Business leaders, innovators and experience designers would soon realize how profound this TED talk was to the rest of the world. Shapshak’s astute observations and message to the rest of the world was years ahead of a revolution that Forbes would call </span><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2016/02/23/chat-bots-facebook-telegram-wechat/#5c9ad9142633"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“the new way we’ll be interacting with computers.”</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toby’s 2013 Ted talk touted that “while the rest of the world is updating statuses and playing games on smartphones, Africa is developing useful SMS-based solutions to everyday needs”. Since 2013 his TED talk has been viewed 1,438,046 times as of July 19, 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward a couple of years and we see more apps than anyone knows what to do with, as well as a notable decrease in</span><a href="http://onereach.com/blog/infographic-mobile-apps-vs-text-messaging/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> usage and app-downloads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This has businesses confused and frustrated. Meanwhile, around the world, messaging (SMS and the ever-encroaching uptake of IP messaging &#8211; Facebook Messenger, Spark, Slack, Kik, SnapChat, etc) is by far the most used function or app on mobile phones &#8211; smart phone or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2016 brought a wave of new businesses and products that fall into the category of </span><a href="http://onereach.com/blog/why-your-business-needs-a-bot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; chat bots, messaging-bots, </span><a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/humans-ai-and-the-user-interface-of-the-future"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conversational-bots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “invisible apps” or &#8220;conversational commerce”. Messaging-bots are popping up for everything, increasingly displacing mobile-apps. New bots are being brought to life daily by startups and household brands alike. Whether the experiences are where they need to be or not, bots existing today which allow you to order a </span><a href="http://onereach.com/blog/i-tried-ordering-dominos-over-text-message-and-it-was-a-total-disaster/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pizza</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, make a payment, read the </span><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/04/media/new-york-times-text-message/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, be reminded of an appointment or even make an appointment. Even </span><a href="http://onereach.com/blog/cities-offer-text-311/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">city and county municipalities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are seeing the value, for example, Washington DC uses a </span><a href="https://onereach.com/bots/#dc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bot for their 311</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">-public services hotline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silicon Valley and other capital ventures hubs around the world have already backed several startups that leverage, if not rely entirely on, bots. Benedict Evans, Partner at the Venture Capital Firm, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz (&#8216;</span><a href="http://www.a16z.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a16z</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeted &#8220;I genuinely can&#8217;t remember the last time a concept blew up as quickly as bots&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, I’ve been part of a business that, like Toby Shapshak, was ahead of the “bot” curve that’s now consuming the business and customer experience worlds. Expedia, Bosch, DHL, Unilever, Stella Artois, HomeAdvisor, The National Domestic Violence Hotline, Red Cross and many others use </span><a href="http://t.yesware.com/tt/40cc1fc6e25c0e6b6c473b6e5d7078c28afa0f2a/489eb37184cda59ba3c43d567cdd0d3e/ac7788ed6176abd000e4ebc066e9c752/l.gbtrck.com/1ab15380-e2b7-425a-9ad9-959cef88b9b1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OneReach</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create (and manage) self-service messaging bots and live communications with their customers. The most popular use-cases include live and automated customer support, proactive order status notifications or order updates, payments/purchasing and text or chat-enabled IVRs (now called chat-bots). Who’d have thought that a bot could reduce 40% of a major brand’s customer support costs, increase revenue by 30% or boost NPS scores?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toby Shapshak seems to have been the oracle that foretold one of the most prolific changes in how consumers and businesses communicate and do commerce. He suggested that bots are “effectively an intersection of the most basic and sophisticated communication. It&#8217;s remarkable that the very rich (in the developed world) and poor (in the developing world) have effectively ended up in the same place (both using bots)”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Years have past since his Ted Talk and we thought it would be valuable to see what Toby thinks of today’s climate and where things go from here. </span></p>
<h2><b>Our interview with Toby Shapshak</b></h2>
<p><b>Elias: </b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Messenger Bots are impacting the everyday life and habits of consumers &#8211; in commerce, purchasing, managing one’s time, getting news and so on. You’ve been watching the impact of messenger bots in Africa for sometime. With this in mind, what perspective would you offer to business leaders and experience-designers on the impact that messenger bots have on consumer habits &#8211; in commerce and purchasing or donations, customer support, managing one’s time, getting news and so on?</span></i></p>
<p><b>Toby:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Business leaders and UX designers should be aware of how chatbots can have an impact on consumer habits; both positively and negatively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the youth of the world, who have grown up using chat, it&#8217;s a logical extension to communicate through this channel, ask questions, even make purchases. Pew Research found that American teenagers were only using email to communicate with &#8220;authority figures&#8221; &#8211; adults, parents and teachers. Now chatting is so dominant that WhatsApp has over a 1 billion users and Facebook Messenger has some 800 million users and 50 million businesses. WeChat has some 800 million users, mostly in China, and has been using bots in a very sophisticated way for a lot longer. Wechat is the future of chatting mingled with commerce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The great thing about SMS &#8211; which is arguably the greatest communication medium the world has ever seen; and the most expensive &#8211; is that it works on every single cellphone, no matter how sophisticated. The other key thing is SMS has a 100% read rate &#8211; even the spam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this context, doing new things like search or shopping via messaging/chat seems obvious to a generation of youngsters that prefer chat to email or anything else. Chat is cheaper and it&#8217;s a paradigm that people understand. It also doesn&#8217;t have a learning curve, the way that conventional apps do. </span></p>
<p><b>Elias: </b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013 you commented that &#8220;while the rest of the world is updating statuses and playing games on smartphones, Africa is developing useful SMS-based solutions to everyday needs”. Is the current wave of messenger bots solving real problems or this just the new version of &#8220;updating statuses and playing games on smartphones”?</span></i></p>
<p><b>Toby: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, a lot of chatbots seem like a nice-to-have. Give them some maturity and we&#8217;ll see if they are a flash-in-the-pan hype or something that will be continuingly useful.</span></p>
<p><b>Elias: </b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the rest of the world catching up or is Africa still ahead and in what ways? What has the rest of the world yet to learn still from African innovation?</span></i></p>
<p><b>Toby: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa is forced to innovate the way it does because there are no other alternatives. it&#8217;s the purest form of innovation out of necessity. More people in Africa have access to a cellphone than to electricity. Because of this there are brilliant power solutions, including solar-power systems like M-Kopa. If you have a pressing problem, it&#8217;s the best incentive in the world to solve it. If you have electricity, what are you likely to do? Watch TV or YouTube. it&#8217;s sadly that simple.</span></p>
<p><b>Elias: </b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are your predictions for where messaging and bots go next, in Africa and elsewhere?</span></i></p>
<p><b>Toby: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sky really is the limit, isn&#8217;t it. Text-based services are revolutionary in Africa, offering everything from Google search via SMS to important health information via South Africa&#8217;s mHealth initiatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin Kelly, the founding executive editor of Wired magazine, said some very interesting things at SXSW this year about how artificial intelligence will become part of our lives. Right now, he says, “it&#8217;s like the early days of cloud computing, but it will ultimately be as sophisticated a service as cloud-based offerings are now”. He called it &#8220;intelligence as a services&#8221;. “Like electricity, which you now buy in what we now call an on-demand model”, Kelly says &#8220;you won’t have to make your AI, you will just purchase it. It will flow like electricity from the grid to wherever you want it. &#8221; He says: &#8220;Artificial intelligence will soon be a commodity&#8221;. AI services at low cost will spur the chatbot industry and make offerings increasingly sophisticated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also the network effect to consider. Part of the reason Google&#8217;s search algorithms are so fast &#8211; and can predict or suggest answers so quickly &#8211; is because of the volume of search queries it has already performed. This inventory of queries and searches mean there is a greater volume of info to reference. As the volume of chatbot data increases, they will also become more effective.</span></p>
<h2><b>Reflection &amp; Looking Forward</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reflecting on Toby Shapshak’s 2013 Ted Talk it’s evident that he saw something revolutionary emerging amidst the noise in the world of experience design, business and technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to the concept of hindsight being 20/20, until 2016 the business world largely ignored the opportunity to leverage the most ubiquitous communication channels in the world (text messaging and IP messaging) for customer support. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/edn-moments/4402146/1st-text-message-is-sent--December-3--1992"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first text message was sent in 1992</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by 2007 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">74% of all mobile phone users worldwide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used text messaging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It took the western business world roughly another 10 years to accept the notion that just maybe they should consider communicating with their customers over the single most prefered communication channel in the world &#8211; SMS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the last 6 years at </span><a href="http://www.onereach.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OneReach,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I’ve been lucky enough to see startups and huge international brands alike use our tools to easily create and iterate on fully reportable and integrated bots. It’s been 3 years since Toby Shapshak’s TED talk and it’s great to finally see so many companies designing for the channels consumers actually prefer (messaging). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we’re here, let’s not be foolish enough to think that leveraging chat bots to drive business impact is any easier because the interface is an ‘old’ technology. The businesses world learned that building any old mobile app really isn’t all that hard. Similar to mobile apps, the success of a today’s chat bots will not be defined by whether or not your company offers chatbots. Success will rest on whether or not your chatbot experiences achieve desired outcomes for your business while being meaningful to your customer.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The city of Evanston, Ill. has worked with OneReach to provide residents with the ability to check the health inspection scores of local restaurants over text.</p>
<p><span id="more-7369"></span>Diners can text the keyword &#8220;food&#8221; to the city&#8217;s 311 number, and then text the name of the restaurant to see the health inspection score, as well as the date the inspection took place.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.govtech.com/health/Texting-Helps-in-Fight-Against-Foodborne-Illnesses-in-Evanston-Ill.html">Government Technology</a> points out that the use of texting makes getting restaurant scores a lot easier for consumers:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s simple and much easier than Yelp’s mobile app, which compels users to tap and swipe their way to a restaurant’s “More Info” tab and deep dive through a list of miscellaneous information.</p></blockquote>
<p>The food safety text initiative follows the city&#8217;s initiative to local restaurant inspection scores onto Yelp.</p>
<p><strong>Check out the full article on <a href="http://www.govtech.com/health/Texting-Helps-in-Fight-Against-Foodborne-Illnesses-in-Evanston-Ill.html">Government Technology</a>, and don&#8217;t forget to <a href="http://onereach.com/resources/high-demand-for-text-message-2014-report">download our report</a> on why 64% of customers would rather text than call your business. </strong></p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Automation was created to make your life easier, not harder. ATMs, IVRs, even vending machines exist for the purpose of enabling self-service &#8211; getting what you need for yourself easily without needing another person to help you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, automation sometimes frustrates customers instead of helping them. Just look at your typical IVR, where pressing the wrong button or mispronouncing something can send you down a path that makes your day a little rainy-er. “Did you say cancel your flight?”&#8230; “No! Change flight.” “Cancelling your flight. Please reschedule.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">We know IVRs and phone trees have a bad rap &#8212;  after all, it’s sort of counterintuitive if the money you’re apparently saving by using automation is ends up frustrating customers. But don’t be mistaken.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7206"></span>It’s too easy to think that customers just “hate automation.” That’s not true &#8212; what they hate is when they can’t get what they want, when and how they want it. For example, you might be forcing them to walk around with a phone glued to their head, while they might love you for offering the same automation over text message &#8211; so they could get on with their day.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sure, IVRs are way less expensive than a call managed by a live agent ($0.15 vs $15) thanks to their automated nature, but where they’re really going to cost you is in the quality of your customer experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.nice.com/summit/2012_Consumer_Channel_Preference_Survey/NICE_2012_Consumer_Survey_Report.pdf">According to a NICE survey</a>, nearly 60% of customers try to bypass the automated phone system to speak with a live agent.</li>
<li>The same survey found that 27% of customers get so frustrated that they hang up.</li>
<li>Over<a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.parature.com/2013-customer-expectations/"> 60% of customers</a> are frustrated by waiting on hold for a long period of time.</li>
<li><a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://onereach.com/callcenter.html">According to a 2011 study</a> by JD Power and Associates, 93% of IVRs decreased overall phone satisfaction compared to talking directly with an agent.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The tool originally intended to cut costs and help customers faster has created more problems than it’s solved. But now customers don’t have to deal with all that phone tree drama. What if they could text your IVR?</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">The New and Improved IVR &#8211; The ITR</h1>
<p dir="ltr">ITR is basically the enlightened era of IVR—a world where businesses get what they want while increasing customer satisfaction.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sounds impossible, but it’s true. With ITR, businesses can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increase cost savings.</strong> Since they’re automated, ITRs bring the same cost savings as  IVRs, plus the additional value your business can quantify the increase in customer satisfaction. Talking with a live agent on the phone costs $15, while text chatting with an agent over a web interface costs only $2-5. Where the real savings come in is in the cost of the text channel vs. the voice channel, because some  that percentage of calls still require a live agent.</li>
<li><strong>Faster time to market.</strong> With today’s tools, you can easily create, and iterate on customer ITR solutions, without expensive budgets or timelines. Save your IT and project resources for other projects &#8211; today you can easily make changes to your ITR or IVR solutions without their help.</li>
<li><strong>Gather more actionable data</strong>. By its nature, spoken word is harder to record than written word, which is why it can be harder to obtain good data and reporting for your IVR. With ITRs, however, you can gather all the data, easily: what words customers used, what flow they engaged in. The context and content of the conversation are recorded and reported back to you. Text messaging is highly reportable, and today’s tools make it easy to capture and report on all of your customer’s live or automated interactions via text message.</li>
<li><strong>Help customers faster.</strong> Customers want service, and they want it fast. Automation delivers that—since the responses are already programmed into the system, customers get responses in record time. In addition, ITR can also eliminate wait times because customers can start a conversation immediately. A study conducted by Harris Poll and commissioned by OneReach found that<a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://onereachcontactcenter.com/high-demand-for-customer-service-via-text-message/"> 44% of customers</a> would rather text an agent immediately than wait on hold.</li>
<li><strong>Engage customers on a channel they want to use.</strong> The same study mentioned above found that 64% of customers would prefer to use texting over voice for customer service. Research by<a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.frost.com/c/10107/blog/blog-display.do?id=3415568&amp;bdata=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mcm9zdC5jb20vYy8xMDEwNy9ibG9nL2luZGV4LmRvP3BhZ2VTaXplPTcmcGFnZT01QH5AQmxvZ0B%2BQDE0MDI2MTU0OTg0NTE%3D"> Frost &amp; Sullivan</a> also found that automated text is preferred over IVR (including speech-based solutions) amongst Millennials and Gen-Yers. If your market is primarily young people (or most of America), texting is the way to go.</li>
<li><strong>Provide a flexible solution that works anywhere, anytime.</strong> When customers use the IVR, they might be in sound sensitive environment that makes it hard to hear prompts or exchange sensitive details, leading to them having to call back at another time. When they do get the chance to talk, they’re stuck on on hold. With ITR, your customers can use a solution that works where they are, when they want. Remember, background noise isn’t a factor with text, and neither is hold times: customers can solve their problems in any environment when it’s convenient for them. (ITR also comes with the added benefit of exchanging sensitive information without saying it out loud).</li>
<li><strong>Adapt to customers’ needs.</strong> One of the biggest complaints about IVR is that it doesn’t put customers in contact with live agents easily. But, as mentioned above, over 40% customers would rather text an agent immediately than wait on hold. With ITR, if customers want to immediately talk to an agent, they can easily switch from automation to a live agent with the push of a button. Plus, customer data is available across channels, so if they do need to switch from one channel to another, the context is still there.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">There are quite a few companies out there doing a great job of using ITR (although they might not call it that). <a href="https://paybyphone.com/">Pay By Phone</a> is improving everyday experiences by making it easy to pay by text, and although the it’s not a very dynamic experience, <a href="http://www.opentable.com/start/home">OpenTable</a> texts customers when their table is ready &#8211; which has increased customer satisfaction and decreased no-shows. In addition, <a href="https://www.text4baby.org/">Text4Baby</a>, a non-profit organization, texts pregnant mothers tips about taking care of themselves and their babies during pregnancy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All of these examples are either not interactive, or are interactive in a very limited way &#8211; but it’s a start!</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h1>
<p dir="ltr">In the past, businesses have used automation to cut costs and (inadvertently) wreck the customer experience. But that’s the past, and this is the present. It’s time for a more intelligent automated system, and it’s here with ITR.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Raise your hand if you hate phone-trees.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Yep, my hand is up too.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But what if you didn’t have to interrupt your day to glue your phone to your ear, listening to the same monotonous options play while you put your day on hold.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What I’m about to tell you next may seem shocking, but it’s true.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You can text phone trees now.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Crazy, right? Actually, not so much.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7164"></span>Technologically speaking, there’s no reason that companies can’t offer you this convenience. Any landline can be text-enabled; companies just haven’t started acting on it until now.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now you might be wondering, “What does it takes to enable such a wonderful experience for your customers?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s really not complicated or expensive, and you can get it up and running pretty quick. (With OneReach, you can have everything ready to go in less than 24 hours). Text-enabled phone-trees or IVRs are a win-win, for the customer and the business. Customers can get answers<a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=273"> when they want and how they want</a>—they can even walk away from the phone if they need to. They can also shorten their service experience to a quick series of texts instead of sitting through a lengthy phone conversation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Businesses offering interactive text response (ITR) can increase efficiency for their customer service/support group. For example, if a customer is more satisfied with the automation they are offered, they’re less likely to need a real person to help them. If they do need a real person, the cost of servicing them will be reduced because A) an agent (responding via web-chat to texts) can service more than one customer at a time B) agents can be provided with more context before being connected to solve the customer’s problem faster.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you’re wondering whether or not would actually want to text your company, <a href="http://onereachcontactcenter.com/high-demand-for-customer-service-via-text-message/">recent research</a> by Harris Interactive and commissioned by OneReach says yes, they would: 64% of Americans would prefer text messaging over calling when getting customer support. (You can download the <a href="http://onereachcontactcenter.com/high-demand-for-customer-service-via-text-message/">FREE report in full here</a>).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Would it actually be more convenient? Sure it would.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You don’t have to be the parent of screaming children to appreciate that it would simply be more convenient to not have to be glued to the phone, incapable of doing anything else, just because of you have a question about your bill/a product/your account/change of address, etc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Convenience, preferred method of communication, easy to use&#8230;what are you waiting for?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">With technological advances flooding the market everyday, interactive voice response (IVR) is looking more and more like a thing of the past.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Modern speech technology dates as far back as the 1930s, but IVRs didn’t really come into their own until the late ‘90s. In theory, customers would be empowered to solve their own problems while agents would be able to handle more pressing calls with IVR. In actuality, this new system caused companies to value speed over service, stressing out agents while creating more and more dissatisfied customers.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7141"></span>For businesses, it’s been a lot cheaper to use IVR over a live agent. A call handled by IVR <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/analystreports/enterprise-application/forrester-tei-atg-359304.pdf">costs an average of 15 cents</a>, while a call handled by a live agent costs an average of $15—a hundred times more expensive than IVR. Using IVR also manages calls more efficiently than a live agent, allowing calls at any time and automatically connecting customers to the solution for their problem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately for customers, IVRs have often created more problems than they solve, like an unsatisfactory experience. Despite its relatively straightforward design, customers are frustrated by the soulless auto attendant and endless rerouting. Only 15% of consumers think IVR use<a href="http://www.interactions.net/2011/06/so-people-hate-ivr-is-this-news-to-anyone/"> benefits them</a>, while 34% think they benefit the company.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Out With The Old, In With The New</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Luckily there’s a solution that benefits everybody—interactive text response, or ITR. Building off of its IVR predecessor, ITR introduces us to a world where businesses get what they want (more business!) while increasing customer satisfaction. Companies can personalize texts and notify customers about orders, prescriptions, you name it, and they can automate messages to save time and money. They also have the benefit of switching to live text chat if a customer wants more information, and are able to handle multiple conversations at once.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Companies can also eliminate one of the customers’ main frustrations (long hold times) with ITR. Customers get their questions answered in real-time without having to sit through the phone tree; in fact, over 80% of customers hate doing that. Texting is also a lot more convenient than phone calls—it’s quieter in a loud location, and customers don’t have to be tied to their phones while waiting for a response. If they do text chat with a live agent, they’re still able to have a two-way conversation without switching to another device.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">ITR In Action</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Organizations ranging from restaurants to schools to banks have already started using texting to contact their customers. Or, in the case of Bowling Green State University, their students. Newly admitted students at BGSU can text chat current students with any questions or concerns they have; over 90% of students choose to opt-in to the program. Students<a href="http://www.bgsu.edu/admissions/next-steps/for-freshmen/entering-summer-term.html"> can also receive text enrollment updates</a> and deadline notification in the weeks leading up to classes. Students like using text because it’s their channel of choice and they ask questions they normally wouldn’t over voice. The school likes it too since because they get more responses than they could with just voice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The important thing to remember about ITR is that it’s interactive—it’s not just one-way communication (even though that’s how it’s been used up until now). Customers hate phone trees because they’re not having an actual dialogue; they’re just pressing buttons. ITR engages the customers in a conversation, automated or live. Having that two-way text communication will end up separating the inactive from the innovators.</p>
