				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July of 2013 Toby Shapshak, the South African speaker, strategist and editor of Stuff Magazine, did a TED talk called </span><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/toby_shapshak_you_don_t_need_an_app_for_that?language=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You Don’t Need An App For That</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Business leaders, innovators and experience designers would soon realize how profound this TED talk was to the rest of the world. Shapshak’s astute observations and message to the rest of the world was years ahead of a revolution that Forbes would call </span><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2016/02/23/chat-bots-facebook-telegram-wechat/#5c9ad9142633"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“the new way we’ll be interacting with computers.”</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toby’s 2013 Ted talk touted that “while the rest of the world is updating statuses and playing games on smartphones, Africa is developing useful SMS-based solutions to everyday needs”. Since 2013 his TED talk has been viewed 1,438,046 times as of July 19, 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward a couple of years and we see more apps than anyone knows what to do with, as well as a notable decrease in</span><a href="http://onereach.com/blog/infographic-mobile-apps-vs-text-messaging/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> usage and app-downloads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This has businesses confused and frustrated. Meanwhile, around the world, messaging (SMS and the ever-encroaching uptake of IP messaging &#8211; Facebook Messenger, Spark, Slack, Kik, SnapChat, etc) is by far the most used function or app on mobile phones &#8211; smart phone or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2016 brought a wave of new businesses and products that fall into the category of </span><a href="http://onereach.com/blog/why-your-business-needs-a-bot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; chat bots, messaging-bots, </span><a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/humans-ai-and-the-user-interface-of-the-future"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conversational-bots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “invisible apps” or &#8220;conversational commerce”. Messaging-bots are popping up for everything, increasingly displacing mobile-apps. New bots are being brought to life daily by startups and household brands alike. Whether the experiences are where they need to be or not, bots existing today which allow you to order a </span><a href="http://onereach.com/blog/i-tried-ordering-dominos-over-text-message-and-it-was-a-total-disaster/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pizza</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, make a payment, read the </span><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/04/media/new-york-times-text-message/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, be reminded of an appointment or even make an appointment. Even </span><a href="http://onereach.com/blog/cities-offer-text-311/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">city and county municipalities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are seeing the value, for example, Washington DC uses a </span><a href="https://onereach.com/bots/#dc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bot for their 311</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">-public services hotline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silicon Valley and other capital ventures hubs around the world have already backed several startups that leverage, if not rely entirely on, bots. Benedict Evans, Partner at the Venture Capital Firm, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz (&#8216;</span><a href="http://www.a16z.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a16z</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeted &#8220;I genuinely can&#8217;t remember the last time a concept blew up as quickly as bots&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, I’ve been part of a business that, like Toby Shapshak, was ahead of the “bot” curve that’s now consuming the business and customer experience worlds. Expedia, Bosch, DHL, Unilever, Stella Artois, HomeAdvisor, The National Domestic Violence Hotline, Red Cross and many others use </span><a href="http://t.yesware.com/tt/40cc1fc6e25c0e6b6c473b6e5d7078c28afa0f2a/489eb37184cda59ba3c43d567cdd0d3e/ac7788ed6176abd000e4ebc066e9c752/l.gbtrck.com/1ab15380-e2b7-425a-9ad9-959cef88b9b1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OneReach</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create (and manage) self-service messaging bots and live communications with their customers. The most popular use-cases include live and automated customer support, proactive order status notifications or order updates, payments/purchasing and text or chat-enabled IVRs (now called chat-bots). Who’d have thought that a bot could reduce 40% of a major brand’s customer support costs, increase revenue by 30% or boost NPS scores?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toby Shapshak seems to have been the oracle that foretold one of the most prolific changes in how consumers and businesses communicate and do commerce. He suggested that bots are “effectively an intersection of the most basic and sophisticated communication. It&#8217;s remarkable that the very rich (in the developed world) and poor (in the developing world) have effectively ended up in the same place (both using bots)”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Years have past since his Ted Talk and we thought it would be valuable to see what Toby thinks of today’s climate and where things go from here. </span></p>
<h2><b>Our interview with Toby Shapshak</b></h2>
<p><b>Elias: </b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Messenger Bots are impacting the everyday life and habits of consumers &#8211; in commerce, purchasing, managing one’s time, getting news and so on. You’ve been watching the impact of messenger bots in Africa for sometime. With this in mind, what perspective would you offer to business leaders and experience-designers on the impact that messenger bots have on consumer habits &#8211; in commerce and purchasing or donations, customer support, managing one’s time, getting news and so on?</span></i></p>
<p><b>Toby:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Business leaders and UX designers should be aware of how chatbots can have an impact on consumer habits; both positively and negatively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the youth of the world, who have grown up using chat, it&#8217;s a logical extension to communicate through this channel, ask questions, even make purchases. Pew Research found that American teenagers were only using email to communicate with &#8220;authority figures&#8221; &#8211; adults, parents and teachers. Now chatting is so dominant that WhatsApp has over a 1 billion users and Facebook Messenger has some 800 million users and 50 million businesses. WeChat has some 800 million users, mostly in China, and has been using bots in a very sophisticated way for a lot longer. Wechat is the future of chatting mingled with commerce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The great thing about SMS &#8211; which is arguably the greatest communication medium the world has ever seen; and the most expensive &#8211; is that it works on every single cellphone, no matter how sophisticated. The other key thing is SMS has a 100% read rate &#8211; even the spam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this context, doing new things like search or shopping via messaging/chat seems obvious to a generation of youngsters that prefer chat to email or anything else. Chat is cheaper and it&#8217;s a paradigm that people understand. It also doesn&#8217;t have a learning curve, the way that conventional apps do. </span></p>
<p><b>Elias: </b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013 you commented that &#8220;while the rest of the world is updating statuses and playing games on smartphones, Africa is developing useful SMS-based solutions to everyday needs”. Is the current wave of messenger bots solving real problems or this just the new version of &#8220;updating statuses and playing games on smartphones”?</span></i></p>
<p><b>Toby: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, a lot of chatbots seem like a nice-to-have. Give them some maturity and we&#8217;ll see if they are a flash-in-the-pan hype or something that will be continuingly useful.</span></p>
<p><b>Elias: </b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the rest of the world catching up or is Africa still ahead and in what ways? What has the rest of the world yet to learn still from African innovation?</span></i></p>
<p><b>Toby: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa is forced to innovate the way it does because there are no other alternatives. it&#8217;s the purest form of innovation out of necessity. More people in Africa have access to a cellphone than to electricity. Because of this there are brilliant power solutions, including solar-power systems like M-Kopa. If you have a pressing problem, it&#8217;s the best incentive in the world to solve it. If you have electricity, what are you likely to do? Watch TV or YouTube. it&#8217;s sadly that simple.</span></p>
<p><b>Elias: </b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are your predictions for where messaging and bots go next, in Africa and elsewhere?</span></i></p>
<p><b>Toby: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sky really is the limit, isn&#8217;t it. Text-based services are revolutionary in Africa, offering everything from Google search via SMS to important health information via South Africa&#8217;s mHealth initiatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin Kelly, the founding executive editor of Wired magazine, said some very interesting things at SXSW this year about how artificial intelligence will become part of our lives. Right now, he says, “it&#8217;s like the early days of cloud computing, but it will ultimately be as sophisticated a service as cloud-based offerings are now”. He called it &#8220;intelligence as a services&#8221;. “Like electricity, which you now buy in what we now call an on-demand model”, Kelly says &#8220;you won’t have to make your AI, you will just purchase it. It will flow like electricity from the grid to wherever you want it. &#8221; He says: &#8220;Artificial intelligence will soon be a commodity&#8221;. AI services at low cost will spur the chatbot industry and make offerings increasingly sophisticated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also the network effect to consider. Part of the reason Google&#8217;s search algorithms are so fast &#8211; and can predict or suggest answers so quickly &#8211; is because of the volume of search queries it has already performed. This inventory of queries and searches mean there is a greater volume of info to reference. As the volume of chatbot data increases, they will also become more effective.</span></p>
<h2><b>Reflection &amp; Looking Forward</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reflecting on Toby Shapshak’s 2013 Ted Talk it’s evident that he saw something revolutionary emerging amidst the noise in the world of experience design, business and technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to the concept of hindsight being 20/20, until 2016 the business world largely ignored the opportunity to leverage the most ubiquitous communication channels in the world (text messaging and IP messaging) for customer support. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/edn-moments/4402146/1st-text-message-is-sent--December-3--1992"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first text message was sent in 1992</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by 2007 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">74% of all mobile phone users worldwide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used text messaging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It took the western business world roughly another 10 years to accept the notion that just maybe they should consider communicating with their customers over the single most prefered communication channel in the world &#8211; SMS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the last 6 years at </span><a href="http://www.onereach.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OneReach,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I’ve been lucky enough to see startups and huge international brands alike use our tools to easily create and iterate on fully reportable and integrated bots. It’s been 3 years since Toby Shapshak’s TED talk and it’s great to finally see so many companies designing for the channels consumers actually prefer (messaging). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we’re here, let’s not be foolish enough to think that leveraging chat bots to drive business impact is any easier because the interface is an ‘old’ technology. The businesses world learned that building any old mobile app really isn’t all that hard. Similar to mobile apps, the success of a today’s chat bots will not be defined by whether or not your company offers chatbots. Success will rest on whether or not your chatbot experiences achieve desired outcomes for your business while being meaningful to your customer.</span></p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Startups can be crazy, exciting places to work. While it can often feel like there are more balls in the air than hands to catch them, somehow everything ends up getting done. This is because, many times in startups, people from one department jump into another department to tackle the tasks at hand.</p>
<p>The collaborative, hands-on nature of startups is a great example of cross-functionality at work. <a href="http://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/crossfunctional">Cross-functional teams</a> combine the strengths and talents of different individuals to reach a common goal. Applied to customer service, cross-functional support means uniting individuals from several different departments (marketing, sales, operations, etc.) to figure out how to provide the best service possible to customers.</p>
<h2><span id="more-7343"></span><strong>How cross-functional support can benefit your company</strong></h2>
<p>Teamwork is an essential part of any startup or established company’s success, but working as a team to meet the needs of a customer is an entirely separate challenge. Cross-functional teams, however, are uniquely equipped to meet that challenge by using their respective skills to collaborate on a customer’s problem.</p>
<p>Venture capitalist <a href="http://tomtunguz.com/churn/">Tomasz Tunguz</a> sums up his thoughts on collaboration:</p>
<blockquote><p>The customer success team is on the front lines with customers passing feedback to product and marketing. Customer success provides a check on the sales team, ensuring the right customers are prioritized and closed.</p></blockquote>
<p>The best way to understand a product is to use it, so what better way for marketers to learn what prospects want than to provide customer support for that product every once in awhile? The same goes for product teams, executives, etc.</p>
<p>Cross-functionality also allows companies to create more personal, customer-centric interactions thanks to multi-departmental insight. Take what Kleiner Perkins partners Ted Schlein and Creighton Hicks recently said about <a href="http://www.kpcb.com/blog/the-magic-of-customer-empathy">customer centricity</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Understanding how users interact with your product is essential to successful product development. It benefits not only design and production, but also marketing, selling and support.</p></blockquote>
<p>This type of collaboration also enables team members to learn new skills and create useful customer service content across departments. For example, if a cross-functional meeting determines that customers have been having trouble using a new product, marketing can create product-specific collateral that sales can later use. Operations can also check in to make sure the new product is working correctly. A combined knowledge of the customer means each department can do their job better. They can also pool resources from across departments (equipment, personnel, etc.) to meet the task at hand.</p>
<p>Cross-functional support can also boost company creativity and allow different departments to bond over a shared purpose – customer success. Each team member can bring their respective strengths and insights to the group to figure out how to improve the customer experience and address problems quickly and efficiently. This also creates a sense of synergy that may not have been there before. Employees from different departments can work together to identify service problems or opportunities that might not have been apparent had the employees not worked together. Once this collaborative group has been established, they can continue innovating and sharing to drive customer service change.</p>
<h2><strong>Using collaboration to optimize and enhance the customer journey</strong></h2>
<p>By collaborating to solve problems encountered throughout the entire customer journey, companies can create more targeted support for each stage. In turn, these hyper-focused interactions will create loyalty, as venture capitalist <a href="http://www.bvp.com/blog/customer-loyalty-magic">Ethan Kurzweil</a> has said. In fact, research has shown that <a href="http://www.thewisemarketer.com/briefs/archive.asp?action=read&amp;bid=4489">over 90% of customers</a> who have an effortless service experience with companies will buy from that company again.</p>
<p>Cross-functional teams can create user personas to identify pain points and probable actions taken throughout their journey, then decide what needs must be addressed. That’s because as the customer passes through each stage of the customer journey, each department has hands-on experience assessing their wants and needs and can pass those insights along to the larger team. When cross-functional teams do come together to reach a goal (in this case providing better service), they combine their knowledge to create a cohesive customer service plan.</p>
<p>Cross-functional support is a great way for each department to get firsthand customer feedback as well as offer exceptional customer service experiences. By prioritizing customer success, companies of all size can benefit from loyal customers and well-rounded teams.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Providing a sophisticated communication experience can be a difficult task. Today’s technology has advanced so much in such a short period of time that businesses have to account for channel proliferation (voice, SMS, social, etc.), multiple touch points (web, contact centers, branches, etc.), the different tasks being performed (reminders, customer support, confirmations, orders, etc.) and channel affinity (which channels customers prefer) when providing service.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7210"></span>In order to accommodate customer needs across channels, businesses have tried various methods, such as using different phone numbers or assigning separate departments to manage each channel. However, <a href="http://cdn.zendesk.com/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf">87% of customers</a> think brands need to do a better job of creating a seamless experience, and <a href="http://www.parature.com/2013-customer-expectations/">over half of customers</a> are frustrated by having to repeat their problems to various customer service representatives. Being shifted from channel to channel without context has created a fractured customer experience.</p>
<p>The factors listed above have made it difficult for executives to strategically manage their communication strategy. Businesses can overcome these obstacles by consolidating their use cases and channels into a single platform (and phone number). In doing so, businesses will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintain brand consistency.</strong> Businesses should represent themselves as similarly as possible across channels, with respect to each channel’s style and constraints. By consolidating communication channels, businesses will be able to make sure the responses and services offered are the same across channels to maintain brand consistency. If customers switch between service channels, they should be able to tell that they’re dealing with the same company.In addition, businesses that manage all their channels within one platform will be able to deliver a more uniform response in terms of tone, appearance and messaging.</li>
<li><strong>Increase ease-of use for customers.</strong> As mentioned above, many customers today <a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.parature.com/2013-customer-expectations/">are frustrated</a> by having to talk to multiple agents or start their conversation over, which contributes to a poor customer experience. The user interface of traditional service channels like the IVR can also have a negative impact, as customers try to use a tool that is often difficult to navigate, sensitive to incorrect input, and <a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.nice.com/summit/2012_Consumer_Channel_Preference_Survey/NICE_2012_Consumer_Survey_Report.pdf">takes too long</a> to connect with an agent. Businesses can address these frustrations with channel pivot, which lets customers switch from one channel to another based on what best suits them and their environment, all without losing context. With regards to switching between voice and texting, <a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://onereachcontactcenter.com/high-demand-for-customer-service-via-text-message/">a Harris Poll study</a> found that 44% of customers would prefer to press a button and start a text conversation immediately rather than wait on hold.</li>
<li><strong>Foster strategic growth.</strong> By consolidating channels, company leadership can view communications in a holistic way and better understand how different channels can be used to support one another. American Express has done an excellent job of this, transferring customers from voice to text to web as they interact with the fraud detection system on their mobile phone. In addition, consolidation onto one platform allows company leadership to determine what channels have seen the most engagement for specific use cases and drive customers to those channels. For example, if customers are using text messaging to reset their password more often than voice, businesses should provide an option within their IVR to switch to text when customers call in to reset passwords. This will increase the chance of customer success as well as satisfaction.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment with rapid iteration.</strong> Businesses that consolidate their communication onto one platform are in a position to run low-risk/high reward experiments. A business using a platform like <a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://onereach.com">OneReach</a> could offer channel pivot between text and voice and monitor how customers use the new channels. If the initial run is successful, businesses can scale their communication strategy to account for increased usage.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The days of siloing customer service channels are over. Businesses that consolidate their channels and use cases will be able to offer a solution where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=273">We’ve spoken before</a> about how awesome texting can be for your business: it’s brief but to the point, and cheaper without skimping on the essentials.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Still, a lot of businesses find it hard to get things right over texting, or to even get things going at all. Some are worried about adding a new channel, and still others are worried if texting is the right new channel to add.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7186"></span>In our experience, we’ve found that a lot this fear stems from a lack of knowledge about texting and what it can do. So, if your business is still on the fence about texting, here are five additional text benefits for your consideration:</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">It’s preferred</h1>
<p dir="ltr">A recent survey conducted by The Harris Poll on behalf of OneReach found that<a href="http://onereachcontactcenter.com/high-demand-for-customer-service-via-text-message/"> 64% of consumers prefer SMS over voice</a> for customer service. In addition, over 80% of consumers agree that it’s frustrating being tied to a phone or computer to wait for service help. Finally, 55% percent of 18-34 year olds would rather text chat with an agent than wait on hold. Put simply—your customers really want a text option.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">It satisfies customers</h1>
<p dir="ltr">According to a 2011 report by J.D. Power and Associates,<a href="http://www.onereach.com/callcenter.html"> 93% of IVRs decreased customer satisfaction</a>. That’s partly because a phone call makes you to sit and wait for an agent to respond while you twiddle your thumbs. Since texting is all about communication on the go, automation via SMS can be navigated at one&#8217;s own pace without being fastened to a call – which increases satisfaction (even if it’s the same automation).</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">It’s a global phenomenon</h1>
<p dir="ltr">SMS trends are hard to keep tabs on, but resources like <a href="http://www.portioresearch.com/en/blog/2013/ott-messaging-apps-are-not-cannibalising-sms-in-the-vast-majority-of-markets.aspx">Portio Research</a> and others offer insights about texting on a worldwide scale. For example, did you know that China is the second largest SMS market in the world after the U.S., or that SMS traffic is growing steadily in Africa (especially useful in light of the Ebola crisis)? Portio predicts that<a href="http://www.portioresearch.com/en/blog/2013/17-incredible-facts-about-mobile-messaging-that-you-should-know.aspx"> people worldwide will send a record 8.3 trillion messages in 2015 alone</a>. If your business hasn’t looked in to texting, it’s potentially missing a lot of opportunities in operations, sales, customer satisfaction and efficiency</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">It can be used in any industry</h1>
<p dir="ltr">We’ve talked a lot about using text in the contact center, but the truth is it can—and is—being used to improve any industry. Are you a restaurant owner?<a href="https://www.seatme.yelp.com/"> Try using texting for reservation reminders</a>. Doctor?<a href="http://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/Newsroom/Articles/News/Optum/2012/0524TextMessages.aspx"> Make sure your patients take their medication on time with text alerts</a>. City official? Text citizens about upcoming events and<a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=629"> let them send you questions back</a>. Whatever industry you’re in, text messaging can give your business a boost.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">It’s for everyone</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Every age or demographic you can think of uses texting. You probably know that millennials make up<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-number-of-texts-sent-2013-3"> the lion’s share of texting traffic</a>, but that doesn’t mean other demographics should be ignored. Over 83% of Gen Xers use text messaging, as do <a href="http://onereachcontactcenter.com/high-demand-for-customer-service-via-text-message/">69% of Baby Boomers</a>. In addition,<a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/09/19/additional-demographic-analysis/"> 85% of African Americans use text messaging</a>, and 87% of Hispanics use it as well. What’s more, households that make under $30,000 a year send twice as many texts as households that make over $75,000. No matter who your client is, you can bet there’s a pretty solid chance they’re using text.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the research cited above, <strong>the most important data will be how it impacts <em>your</em> business and <em>your</em> customers</strong>. This data can be captured in a lightweight and quick to deploy pilot, and that data can inform future decisions. The ease and speed with which such pilots come together consistently amazes our enterprise customers.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">One of our clients has seven telephony providers&#8211;we are the eighth. Thankfully, we’re helping them consolidate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over the last six weeks, we’ve been able to migrate 60 percent of their traffic to the OneReach platform. Good for us, right? But even better for them.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7184"></span>By consolidating vendors, they’ve been able to save themselves time, money, and a heck of a lot of stress. And guess what? You business can do this too. Check out great benefits of consolidation below:</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Centralized management on any scale</h1>
<p dir="ltr">In a centralized company, the most important decisions are made by higher-ups or headquarters instead of branch managers&#8211;decisions are made in one central location and passed downwards. Not only does this save branch managers time, it also ensures that the customer experience is <a href="http://yourbusiness.azcentral.com/advantage-disadvantage-centralizing-management-control-6635.html">consistent</a> and <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc539020.aspx">efficient</a> anywhere in the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">By letting headquarters make the important decisions, everyone reaps the benefits: headquarters can use their knowledge and experience to the company’s advantage, giving branch managers the time to focus on staff, who can then focus on customers. It’s a win-win-win-win scenario.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Centralized data and analytics</h1>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.techradar.com/us/news/world-of-tech/the-importance-of-big-data-analytics-in-business-1267606">According to Gartner analyst Svetlana Sicular</a>, &#8220;Big data is a way to preserve context that is missing in the refined structured data stores.” This might sound complicated, but what she’s basically that data is stronger united than it is divided.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, a lot of companies have their data divided. Each department or branch collects different types of data based on what’s important to them (i.e. channel preferences, purchase history, etc). and stores it in different locations. It’s difficult for businesses to make informed decisions when they aren’t looking at the whole picture.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, centralized data and analytics aim to change all that. <a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=584">Storing data in one central location</a> means employees can retrieve branch-specific or company-wide data in exactly the same place. This provides a better idea of what’s going on company-wide, but also helps them relate data points that had previously been separated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Centralizing data works equally well for customer insight: instead of reaching out to marketing about a customer’s communication preferences, sales can find that information in exactly the same place marketing does.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Increased context</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Centralization and consolidation can be just as great for your customers as it is for your company. After all, customers shouldn’t have to jump from department to department or channel to channel to get the answers they need. The same information should be available regardless of who they contact or how they contact them.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=540">One way to do this is with screen pops</a>—notifications that provide agents with relevant customer information. Instead of going into a customer call blind, agents can then personalize their conversations based on the customer’s past interactions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Automated solutions like IVR can do this too. Instead of presenting each customer with the same generic prompt, your IVR can review Customer A’s past interactions, see that their car is due for a tune-up, then provide them with an immediate option to do so.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Reducing the number of vendors you have isn’t an easy decision to make, and it shouldn’t be. It’s a big leap for any company, but if you do it right, it can be a positive one, too.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">If you&#8217;re a business owner, there might be two tools you are not utilizing that can increase your ROI. Those tools are live chat and text messages. Why should you even think about using live chat and text messages? Let&#8217;s look at this information from <a href="http://econsultancy.com/blog/10644-stats-do-consumers-appreciate-live-chat-on-websites">Econsultancy</a> and <a href="http://advertise.valpak.com/5-ways-to-reach-customers-with-sms-texting/">Valpak</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7181"></span></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">65% of American online shoppers have engaged in live chat</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Live chat has a satisfaction level for customer service: 73% satisfaction level</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">67% of consumers not only like, but want to receive special offers via a text message</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">71% of consumers would like the option of text messaging a company</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Why do consumers like live chat and texting options when doing business?</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">They get their questions answered immediately. With live chat or text, there is no waiting. It&#8217;s the same as talking with a person.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">They can multi-task. With live chat or texting, individuals can be doing multiple things such as working on the computer or taking care of the family.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Consumers say live chat and texting are the most efficient communication methods. The conversation is usually short and gets to the point of what is needed.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">They say they get better information than via email. With live chat and text messaging, you don&#8217;t have to wait for an answer, then ask a follow up question. You get all the information at once.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to those reasons to use live chat or text messages, when your business uses these two tools, you give a great first impression of being available and caring about the customer.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">When you think about texting, what’s the first thing that comes to your mind? Lols and emoticons?</p>
<p dir="ltr">How about closing a business deal?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://heywirebusiness.com/pressreleases/heywire-business-text-messaging-survey-shows-67-percent-of-professionals-are-texting-for-business-2/">Over two-thirds</a> of business professionals are using text messaging for business-related communications. In addition, nearly 75% of business workers text colleagues while over half text external contacts like customers and prospects. With the use of texting rising inside and outside the workplace, business professionals need to start thinking about how texting can help their company.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7126"></span>Over 81% of the U.S. adult population texts&#8211;that’s over 250 million people. Additionally, <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/michael_ogrady/12-06-19-sms_usage_remains_strong_in_the_us_6_billion_sms_messages_are_sent_each_day">6 billion texts</a> are sent in the U.S. each day, far outpacing phone traffic of <a href="http://www.texasinsider.org/3-billion-phone-calls-made-in-us-every-day/">3 billion calls</a> (which, to be fair, is still a lot). By incorporating text, your business can capture some of that valuable text traffic instead of letting it pass you by.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Below are five ways texting stands out as a form of business communication:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>It’s cheaper.</strong> According to a Forrester and Oracle report from 2012, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/analystreports/enterprise-application/forrester-tei-atg-359304.pdf">it costs between $6-20</a> per call in the average contact center. Web chat costs a lot less, only $2-5 per session, and automating text lowers that to just 25 cents per session. Some of our clients have redirected 1/ 3 of their calls to text and automation, decreasing costs by 25%.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>It’s in real-time.</strong> On average, we get more emails a day than we do text messages, but while emails often linger in our inbox, texts are read almost immediately&#8211;just under 90 seconds. Compare that with our email response time, an average of<a href="http://blog.timesunion.com/tech/2459/email-response-time-slows/"> 2.5 days</a> (not that anyone’s counting). Add in the fact that email eats up<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-leadership/post/how-much-time-you-really-spend-emailing-at-work/2012/07/31/gJQAI50sMX_blog.html"> 28% of our average work time</a> and you’ve got one more reason to switch to text.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>It’s flexible.</strong> 81% of customers are frustrated being stuck to a phone or computer for service help. With text, customers can put their phone down and check it again at their leisure (although they usually check it pretty quickly). Texting also allows users to be more discreet than they ever could with voice calls. Maybe you’re exchanging sensitive details or you’re in a loud, crowded space where making a phone call is out of the question. Texting lets you continue that conversation right where you are, when you want.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>It’s short.</strong> William Shakespeare once wrote, “Brevity is the soul of wit.” In plain English, that means “keep it short.” Rambling on and on doesn’t necessarily mean that you know what you’re talking about, or that what you’re saying is any good, and customers know that. They also know that they have a small window of time in which they want to get things done. <a href="http://onereach.com">41% of customers who text</a> are likely to believe that a text-enabled company values their time&#8211;they can get their problem resolved almost instantly without having to deal with a lengthy conversation.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>It’s wanted.</strong> 80% of customers want to text contact centers, and 64% would prefer to perform some kind of customer service activities with text. Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.parature.com/customer-service-buzzword/">only 29%</a> of contact centers offer an SMS capability. With texting ranked as the number one activity one cell phones and as the preferred method of communication for most of the population, you need to engage your customers how they want.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A lot of businesses don’t want to use texting because it’s informal, but that’s exactly what customers love about it. Phone and email are still integral parts of business communication; now it’s time to incorporate SMS.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If your company is one of the many now opting to provide tech support through text, you may be anxious about implementing this new technology. There is good news, however. First of all, integrating text is likely way more simple and straightforward than you think (as you can read about <a href="http://onereachcontactcenter.com/sms/">here</a>). Secondly, the benefits of switching to text-based tech support vastly outweigh the risk of lagging behind in an outdated voice-only system. Here are a few that come to mind.</p>
<h2><span id="more-7106"></span><b>Preference</b></h2>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.practicalecommerce.com/articles/4139-Text-Messaging-Effective-for-Retailers-">practicalecommerce.com</a> there are 4.3 billion people carrying SMS-enabled devices, and of those 96 percent send text messages on a regular basis. In fact, text messaging is the most common activity done on mobile devices (Source: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/KarlPortio/mobile-data-usage-trends-20112015">Portio Research</a>). Plus, those who have used text-based tech support as opposed to the phone-based alternative typically prefer texting.</p>
<h2><b>Privacy</b></h2>
<p>Customers love the fact that they can receive support in a loud or crowded place through texting and not worry about trying to hear the representative. And it makes sense. Who really wants to embarrass themselves in public as they yell “help” repeatedly at an unresponsive IVR? Plus, when people do business while on the move, they often balk at audibly giving or receiving private information. They may not want those around them to hear what they are ordering, what trouble they are having, or what financial changes they would like to make.</p>
<h2><b>Quality</b></h2>
<p>Tech support demand is only increasing as more complex products and services are being offered to consumers. Texting allows a tech support professional to provide a quality experience for the customer by easily and accurately evaluating, troubleshooting, and solving a customer’s issue. With the necessary information in hand, a tech support professional can either solve the problem in the moment or take a few minutes for more thorough research.</p>
<h2><b>Efficiency</b></h2>
<p>It is more efficient for customers to use <a href="http://onereachcontactcenter.com/sms/">text</a> rather than phone, freeing up more time for customer service representatives and increasing productivity. Existing technology allows customers to navigate through a tech support system via texting very quickly. A tiered or tree system will help customers provide information about their problem, making the process both faster and simpler for the technician and customer alike. Plus, a technician can help multiple people at once through this type of support, while it would be impossible to help out more than one customer over the phone at the same time.</p>
<h2><b>Cost</b></h2>
<p>Yes, there might be some initial cost when switching to text due to technology upgrades and training. However, the learning curve will be vastly overshadowed by the timeliness and accuracy of support being delivered. Keep in mind that during the initial phase of creating a text-based tech support system it is important to still allow customers to call in so they can still receive support the way they are used to. As customers become aware of the new system and try it they will undoubtedly use it more than the traditional alternative. It is also worth considering that the average response time to an email is 90 minutes, while the average response time to a text message is 90 seconds according to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyV7ll85MqU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=36s">Responsive Presence.</a> Which seems more cost effective to you?</p>
