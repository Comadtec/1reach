				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout much of history, authors have maintained a distance from readers, their experiences separated by both time and place. As novelist Paolo Coelho noted, writing is “a solitary experience.” The work of the author was often created in isolation—seemingly forged in the rarified air of their literary mountain before being handed down to the waiting masses.</p>
<p>Now, not so much.</p>
<p>Modern writers are encouraged to engage with their readers and, thanks to technology, have numerous possible channels to choose from. This makes the modern author more a reachable human, and less a remote mystic.</p>
<p>This may seem grievous to the lone wolf author who would prefer to remain isolated and mysterious. But the reality in our connected world is that readers expect a level of access to authors, and success in the literary world depends on it. In his editorial piece “<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2012/05/10/the-aloof-author-is-dead-long-live-the-writer/#48b4eb3e2649" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Aloof Author Is Dead, Long Live the Writer</a>,” David DiSalvo of Forbes Magazine writes:</p>
<p>Technology has riddled the barriers between authors and readers full of holes. Ignoring the multiple ways readers can interface with writers isn’t an option — but more to the point, why would anyone want to ignore them? In the new economy, writers must build brands for themselves and maintain them over time. Every mode of interaction with readers offers opportunities to strengthen the brand.</p>
<p>As novelist and blogger Kate Pullinger described in her article “<a href="http://www.katepullinger.com/website_archive/index.php/blog/comments/connecting-readers-to-writers-the-only-possible-future-of-publishing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connecting Readers to Writers: the only possible future of publishing</a>,” “(T)he only important question left, really, is how to connect writers to readers. Any publisher who isn’t addressing this directly and urgently will be in trouble soon.”</p>
<p>While blogs and eBooks have begun providing a somewhat interactive experience, printed literature has remained in the same static place it has for centuries. After all, how can the ancient medium of paper provide a modern interactive experience?</p>
<p>Enter author Amy Krouse Rosenthal.</p>
<p>Amy is bending the world of print media towards truer interactivity by partnering with OneReach to use text-based audience participation. Written in a wry, memoir style, her new book <a href="https://www.textbookamykr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Textbook Amy Krouse Rosenthal</a> invites readers to actively join in the discussion.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the book, readers are encouraged to text “Hello” to a Chicago number (the author’s hometown). A cheery greeting comes back from the author, which sets up a relationship of sorts between author and reader.</p>
<p>At various intervals in the book, Amy prompts the reader to engage by using text inputs to the previously used number. Information either flows from the reader to the author (such as self-portraits and photos) or from the author to the reader (such as audio files of a poet reading his work). All of these inputs are then posted on the author’s website.</p>
<p>This unique immersive experience was done very intentionally. Amy Krouse Rosenthal <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/books/ct-prj-amy-krouse-rosenthal-textbook-20160803-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a> “the text-messaging aspect of the book, at the end of the day, is about connecting with people.” This human need for connection is well-documented and has even been recently called “as fundamental as our need for food and water” by neuroscientist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNhk3owF7RQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew Lieberman</a>.</p>
<p>We are only just beginning to see this connection between author and reader. What OneReach has done is create an interactive and immersive experience that has been lacking up until now. Future writers may be able to construct an entirely new way of providing details or even compel an interaction with their story lines. The possibilities are limited only by the author’s imagination. Consider these:</p>
<p>• Choose Your Own Adventure books. Remember those? Also known as “gamebooks,” they used to let the reader choose different endings and options as they progressed through the pages of the book. How cool would it be to adapt that in a more technologically immersive way? A reader could text their choices and receive instructions for the next step in the story.</p>
<p>• Interactive mysteries. Readers would need to solve part of the mystery before getting a text with the next clue. This would make them almost a character in the story as they help to solve the crime.</p>
<p>• Immersive talk tracks. Imagine going on the Boston walking tour and getting texts showing images of what you’re looking at, but from the colonial period. Bot technology could also be used so you could ask questions about what you’re seeing and get a real-time answer.</p>
<p>• Scavenger hunts. Thanks to the proliferation of activities like Pokemon Go and geocaching, scavenging has never been more popular. Authors can include location-specific or theme-specific clues and readers can respond with the correct answer or upload an image of the item.</p>
<p>• Personalized books. When I was a child, one of my favorite books was a personalized one, where my own name had been included in the storyline. Admittedly, it was done with old technology, and looked like someone had just clumsily fed the template through a typewriter. That didn’t matter to me. I loved the idea that I was part of the story, and felt so very important! Using texts, an author could now give prompts for names, details, and image uploads, essentially having the reader build the story as they go. At the end, readers could even get a digital or printed copy of the story they created.</p>
<p>These are just a few ideas, limited only by the imagination of writers now and in the future. As culture changes, so must the authors and publishing companies operating within it. Although really, no matter how much technology changes, people are—as always—still just earnestly searching for connection. And a writer like Amy Krouse Rosenthal gives them just that.</p>
<p>Try it for yourself and let us know what you think!</p>

<p>You have been slammed with the topic of bots and the details of them, but why do businesses need to understand them?

<h2><span style="font-size: x-large;"><a href="http://customerthink.com/customer-centricity-is-more-than-promotional-hype/">Customer-Centricity is more than Promotional Hype</a> &#8211; by Mitchell Goozé</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">How do companies drive emotional engagement and guarantee they are fully committed to the needs of the customer? According to this article, centricity is key. Providing better customer service will ultimately end up in more profit, which is almost always the end goal for companies. </span></p>

<p>Many businesses are looking at the wide-spread possibilities of artificial intelligence to redefine their industries, businesses and customers. Business leaders are embracing artificial intelligence because consumers are using cognitive applications through phones and in their cars, creating better customer engagement.</p>

<p>Whenever something new is introduced people are naturally skeptical about jumping into it. Building trust between humans and machines is very important and, like any relationship, takes time. People will only trust their bots if they trust the makers of their bots. At OneReach we want to make sure customers trust that we’re acting responsibly behind the curtain, and that we value the significance of their customer experience.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a lot of call center metrics out there that measure customer satisfaction—CSAT, Net Promoter Score (NPS), even First Call Resolution (FCR). The way they measure satisfaction is different, but the end result is the same—to make sure the customer is happy.</p>
<p>But what if I told you there was a call center metric that could do nothing but measure a customer’s happiness, one that tracked their satisfaction through every interaction?</p>
<p>There is, and it’s called the Smiley Face Index (SFI).</p>
<h1><span id="more-7264"></span><strong>What is the Smiley Face Index?</strong></h1>
<p>The Smiley Face Index isn’t meant to displace other more complex call center metrics.  Rather, it’s just the simpler way of looking at customer satisfaction that we sometimes need. It literally measures the number of smiley faces exchanged by a customer and agent during a web-chat or text message interaction. Simply put, more smiley faces = more happy customers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.icmi.com/~/media/Images/Resources/Articles/2015/09/SmileyIndex.ashx" alt="call center metrics smile" width="461" height="165" /></p>
<p>Smiley faces are symbols that have meaning—they show how happy or excited we are. And while The Smiley Face Index might not be as all-encompassing or sophisticated as other metrics, it is a great way to get a feel for current customer sentiment, and also assess agent performance in real time.</p>
<p>For example, if Agent A is has 10 interactions with customers and none of the customers send smiley faces, that could mean one of two things: either they didn’t feel like sending a smiley face, or the service provided didn’t warrant a smiley face.</p>
<p>However, if Agent B has 10 interactions with customers and 7 out of 10 send smiley faces, then, as a contact center manager, you can tell that that agent is doing something right. That’s not to say that Agent A isn’t doing a good job—it just means that Agent B is doing something that warrants smiles from customers.</p>
<p>And you can bet that even if a customer is prompted to give a smiley face, they’re certainly not going to unless it’s merited. However, it’s good to remember that <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118562/emoticons-effect-way-we-communicate-linguists-study-effects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">women are twice as likely to use emoticons as men</a>, as found in a study from Rice University.</p>
<p>We’ve even seen some companies close out their support tickets/sessions by simply asking “Have I made you <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> or <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ? Is there anything else I can help you with?”</p>
<p>Ultimately, if no agents are getting smiley faces, it could be an indicator that the current level of service is worth putting some thought into.</p>
<h1><strong>What makes SFI different from other call center metrics</strong></h1>
<p>While the Smiley Face Index can be subjective, it is a quick, practical tool that you can use right away to get a quick “thermometer-read” at any given time &#8211; real time&#8230;like the heartbeat monitor of happiness.</p>
<p>You see, the point of the Smiley Face Index isn’t to get the most smiley faces—it’s to provide such great service that you make your customer smile. A lot of other metrics and measurements around customer satisfaction don’t address that—they deal strictly with numbers and scores, with definitions and averages.</p>
<p>The genius of the Smiley Face Index is that it eschews all the <strong>common call center metrics</strong> (which are all very important, don’t get me wrong) to focus on the importance of pleasing customers and making it a daily focus. It literally tracks whether or not the experience you’re providing can garner a  smile. If you review a digital interaction ending in a smiley face, you can see what was so good about it and build off of that. Was it resolved on the first try? Was it handled in under X minutes? You can learn from that experience to build better ones.</p>
<h1><strong>Service with a smile</strong></h1>
<p>One of our clients, a staffing agency, decided to offer customers the ability to text after using a clunky IVR for several years. They let customers channel pivot from voice to SMS and were able to deflect over 40% of calls to SMS.</p>
<p><a href="https://helix.northwestern.edu/article/kindness-contagious-new-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kindness has been shown to be contagious</a>, so if one person is happy and shares that (ie a customer), it will make the agent happy as well. Positive feedback is shown to be “<a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ayelet.fishbach/research/FEF%20Compass%202010.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more effective in goal pursuit</a>”, which we could build on to mean that tracking SFI could help agents do their job better. In fact, studies have found that positive people are also better at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2580208/Does-happiness-make-SMARTER-Positive-people-better-solving-problems-unhappy-counterparts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">solving problems</a>.</p>
<p>Another one of our clients, a health and wellness company, deployed SMS support for their VIP users. The users were ecstatic about being able to text for support, saying things like “I love it” or sending a smiley face. In this case, the new users were shown something happy (a new service that was a benefit of their membership) and were excited to start using it (saying, “this is crazy awesome!”). In addition, a smiley face <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> is the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcc4.12063/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most-used emoticon</a>, and a<a href="http://news.psu.edu/story/358366/2015/05/21/research/emoticons-may-signal-better-customer-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gents who use emoticons</a> are more likely to receive higher scores than agents who don’t use emoticons. That could be because “<a href="http://www.herizons.ca/node/554" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the emoticon is arguably a linguistic strengthener</a> that enhances the recipient’s understanding of the tone behind the text.”</p>
<p>Simply put, happiness (and smiles) broaden your mind.</p>
<p>There are plenty of examples of customer experiences that have made customers smile—what makes customers happy will ultimately vary by industry or channel. However, the Smiley Face Index should, at the very least, be a new way of looking at something, or at the very best, be a force for galvanizing change and prioritizing happiness, for your customers and your agents.</p>
<h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>
<p>Now, The Smiley Face Index isn’t meant to replace traditional call center metrics, nor should it. It’s supposed to be another perspective on achieving what should be each contact center’s ultimate goal—making the customer happy.</p>
<p>So, are you delivering service worth smiling about?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tired of ordering pizza over the phone? Domino’s understands—that’s why they’ve launched <a href="anyware.dominos.com">AnyWare</a>, letting you “order your favorite oven-baked goodness on your favorite devices.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not going to lie—this is a pretty awesome use case (in theory). With AnyWare, you can text, tweet and even use your Smart TV to order pizza and more, and all you have to do is send a pizza emoji.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-7253"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D1SrOjuBSEU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Easy as (pizza) pie, right?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not so much, which kinda sucks because I was really excited by the prospect of being able to text to order a pizza. (No really, I was).</span></p>
<p><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-text-1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1743 size-medium" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-text-1-264x300.png" alt="dominos text 1" width="264" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See, the key to ordering pizza from Domino’s on any of your smart devices lies in creating a Pizza Profile apparently, where you have to input your name, email address, and phone number to get your hands on that slice of cheese. By creating an account, you’re able to Easy Order based off of past purchases and skip entering your personal payment information every time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re all about text messaging and effortless service at OneReach, so this seemed like a great use case to test out. Pizza + texting = success, right?!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excited with the thought of pizza for lunch, and with my stomach growling, I went off to create my Pizza Profile. However, hitting the site should have been my first clue as to what I was about to experience because apparently you have to divulge your deepest, darkest secrets to order a pizza. After logging in to enable text ordering, I was presented with a whole lot of pizza legalese asking for my consent.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1744" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos1-546x331.png" alt="dominos1" width="546" height="331" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I entered my phone number and saved my settings. Next, I had to double opt-in to confirm that I did, in fact, want to order pizza.  </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/dominos-text-2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1741 size-medium" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-text-2-e1440719073409-289x300.png" alt="dominos text 2" width="289" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, I had to set up an Easy Order (oh, how I wish it had been) so the system knew what to query. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-double-optin.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1745 size-large" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-double-optin-546x255.png" alt="dominos double optin" width="546" height="255" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost done? I wish! The pop-up told me I had to place my order </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">online</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before I could use text messaging. Honestly, I kind of got the feeling this was a cash grab to get everyone to order way more pizzas than they need, all for supposed convenience’s sake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was at a loss. I didn’t even know </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">where </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to place my Easy Order. Luckily, my phone came to my rescue when I opted in to receive messages and I could start placing my Easy Order.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/dominos-text-3.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1746 size-medium" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-text-3-e1440719007201-269x300.png" alt="dominos text 3" width="269" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just kidding&#8211;I had to go back online </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">again</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So far, not so easy.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/dominos-text-4.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1747 size-medium" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-text-4-e1440719030547-289x300.png" alt="dominos text 4" width="289" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, I don’t want to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheese it up</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—I just want to order my damn pizza over text message.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-cheese-it-up.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1748" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-cheese-it-up.png" alt="dominos cheese it up" width="457" height="291" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C’mon, this is supposed to be easy! I just want to order my pizza over text message!!</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-chocolate.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1749" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-chocolate-546x291.png" alt="dominos chocolate" width="546" height="291" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, on the payment page, I found what I was looking for.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-easy-order.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1750" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-easy-order.png" alt="dominos easy order" width="318" height="142" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awesome. Easy Order saved. Right? Wrong. Even though I submitted my order (14” with pepperoni and mushrooms), I still had no Easy Order to show for it. At this point, I was getting really frustrated (and hungry).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to be deterred, I tried once again to order over text, but because I didn’t save my credit card information, I couldn’t order. Because guess what—the only way to update your payment method is to MAKE ANOTHER PAYMENT.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-credit-card-2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1751" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-credit-card-2-546x73.png" alt="dominos credit card 2" width="546" height="73" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seriously. Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still aiming for my end goal of ordering pizza over text message, I went back <em>online</em> to order something cheap (3 20 oz. sodas) to re-enter my payment information. And when I went back to my phone and texted my little pizza emoji, guess what? Still didn’t work, because life sucks sometimes.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/dominos-text-5.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1752 size-medium" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-text-5-e1440718690657-289x300.png" alt="dominos text 5" width="289" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, the delivery guy was nice enough to deliver my two orders together, and when I asked if my online credit card payment went through (because according to the texts, it wasn’t valid), he showed me the receipt, where it clearly did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, not only was I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> able to order over text message, but I had a heck of a time even trying to order online.</span></p>
<p>The goal of this article is not to bash Domino’s&#8211;they should be applauded for even attempting to deploy a text-to-order service. In addition, I’m assuming that once I got my Easy Order set up, it would have been as easy to order as advertised instead of what I went through.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1753" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1753" style="width: 546px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-happy.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-1753" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-happy-546x287.png" alt="This is definitely not how I felt after trying to order. Photo from Domino&quot;sss" width="546" height="287" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1753" class="wp-caption-text">This is definitely NOT how I felt after trying to order. Photo from Domino&#8217;s AnyWare video.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, what’s ultimately lacking from the Domino’s AnyWare experience is the “anywhere” aspect of it. Domino’s tried and failed to create a seamless omnichannel experience that lets you order pizza whenever, wherever, and however you want. It relied too heavily on the Web to enable an experience that should have taken place largely on other channels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A true omnichannel experience would have seamlessly transferred customers from channel to channel (ie a link to a secure payment page for ordering), rather than forcing them back to the Web to do the very thing they should have been able to do by texting or tweeting: order pizza.</span></p>
<h1><b>Text Domino’s 2.0</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though I didn’t get my pizza over text message, I still wanted to see if there was a better way to design this whole text debacle. Because even though it didn’t work, it should have worked. And it can work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how it should have been done (and can be done). Domino’s, feel free to use this model PUH-LEESE!</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, I would text into Domino’s, without needing a Pizza Profile. That was the one part of the user experience that continuously failed me, </span><a href="http://www.eater.com/2015/5/20/8631373/i-ordered-dominos-pizza-emoji-it-took-three-hours-twitter"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and I’m not</span></a> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/20/dominos-tweet-to-order-system-isnt-as-great-as-it-sounds/#.v3rtkt:wfb2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the only one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Had I not been so committed to seeing this through, I would have bailed with many profanities following and ordered from Papa John’s.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would receive a text message asking if I’d like to place my usual order (not Easy Order, because that sure as heck wasn’t easy), or if I’d like to place a new one.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system would already know my address and billing information, so I wouldn’t have to input that information online, taking me out of my mobile experience. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d confirm that I’d like the pizza delivered to my regular address.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system would then ask me if I’d like to pay with the card I already have on file.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d confirm, and then I’d get a message that my pizza was on my way.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy as that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, why tell you when I can show you? Here’s how it would look&#8230;</span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-2388 aligncenter" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-texting2.png" alt="text dominos" width="301" height="573" /></p>
<p>Want to try a great text-to-order experience for yourself? <strong>Text “PIZZA” to 70700.</strong> Note&#8211;you won’t actually be ordering pizza, and there are no integrations to find the nearest Domino’s or to pay for pizza. Still, it’s an example of what a smart ordering experience could be (and should have been) like.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy!</span></p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are 7.125 billion people in the world. Each person is a unique, complex individual with their own likes and dislikes. Unfortunately, less than 50% of global businesses offer personalized customer service, despite a desire from <a href="https://www.avaya.com/usa/documents/media-summary-for-avaya-cem-global-november-2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">70% of customers</a>. And while <a href="https://www.avaya.com/usa/documents/media-summary-for-avaya-cem-global-november-2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">69% of customers</a> expect businesses to link communication channels together in real time, only 38% of businesses offer that.</p>
<p>However, there’s an inherent danger in generalizing global customer service, partly because expectations vary from country to country. For example, in Japan, customers experience <em><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303456104579489824193262260" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">omotenashi</a></em>, or the absolute dedication of service to a customer and their needs. In South Africa, customer service employees are expected adhere to the principles of <a href="http://www.tourism.gov.za/AboutNDT/Publications/tourism%20report%20final%2028%20january%202011_22%20march.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Batho Pele</a> (People First), which include high levels of courtesy and service standards. But in Eastern Europe, customer service representatives view service as more of transaction than a relationship, <a href="http://www.berlitz.com.uy/SiteData/docs/BerlitzCul/691862a1aef0a178/Berlitz_Culture&amp;CustomerServiceExperience.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">putting customers on hold</a> without asking and addressing customers in a direct manner.</p>
<p>But meeting cultural expectations is just one of the many challenges of global customer service.</p>
<p><span id="more-7250"></span>Listed below are some of the common challenges global customers face, along with a solution to each of them.</p>
<h1>Challenge: Response time and resolution</h1>
<p>If there’s one universal customer service complaint, it’s waiting on hold. <a href="http://www.parature.com/2013-customer-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Over 60% of global customers</a> are frustrated by waiting on hold for a long time, but what constitutes a long time will vary from country to country:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less than half of <a href="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">German customers</a> think response times are “good” or “excellent.”</li>
<li><a href="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">French customers </a>think their phone calls should be answered immediately. In fact, <a href="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">73% of French consumers</a> expect an immediate response on any channel, and they expect their problem to be solved then and there.</li>
<li><a href="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brazilian customers</a> have high standards that appear to be met—81% think the speed of response is either “good” or “excellent,” and 82% rate resolution the same way.</li>
<li>Only 35% of British consumers are satisfied with the speed of response, and only 36% are satisfied with resolution</li>
<li><a href="http://www.itweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=67603" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">South African customers </a>expect an answer to their phone call in under three minutes.</li>
<li><a href="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Only 30% of Japanese customers</a> expect an answer right away, compared to a global average of 50%.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solution: Automation and time-based routing to other agents</h2>
<p>As listed above, many global customers expect answers to their questions almost immediately. When they receive poor service, <a href="http://trendwatching.com/trends/future-customer-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">66% of global consumers</a> will stop doing business one brand and switch to another. However, agents are only available so many hours in a day, and not all calls may require human intervention. Automated time-based routing can immediately direct callers to other available agents. Alternatively, automation provides customers with the option to self-serve, which <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/stevenvanbelleghem/the-self-serving-economy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">40% of customers</a> would prefer. Either way, an automated communication solution ensures customers get the answers they need when they need it.</p>
<h1>Challenge: Channel preference</h1>
<p>You might think phone would be the preferred international communication channel, but that’s not the case.<a href="https://www.avaya.com/usa/documents/media-summary-for-avaya-cem-global-november-2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Over 35%</a> of European consumers think the phone delivers the worst customer experience, and about <a href="http://www.lithium.com/company/news-room/press-releases/2014/extreme-customer-expectations-have-gone-global" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-thirds of American</a>, British and Australian customers will only use the phone as a last resort. In fact, several other countries use other customer service channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>While most Australian customers (59%) use the phone, they also use <a href="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alternative channels</a> like self-service (33%) and live chat (21%).</li>
<li><a href="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Over 60% of Brazilians</a> will try any channel available to get their problem solved quickly.</li>
<li><a href="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Over half of Japanese customers</a> would be willing to use self-service channels to solve their problem.</li>
<li><a href="http://graphics.eiu.com/upload/customerservice_DHL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">81% of Asian consumers</a> like to resolve problems online.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.itweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=67603" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">South Africans</a> prefer phone calls when interacting with a contact center.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solution: Engage with customers using SMS</h2>
<p>A study conducted by Harris Poll and commissioned by OneReach found that <a href="http://onereach.com/resources/high-demand-for-text-message-2014-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">64% of American consumers</a>would rather text than call for customer service. While the poll was strictly limited to the United States, the use of and preference for text message spans across the world. Over 75% of cell phone owners worldwide use text messaging, and for some of the poorest countries in the world, texting is the most used feature on their phone. Although global restrictions may vary, the high usage of SMS and the global preference for any channel other than phone make SMS a strong, affordable global customer service channel.</p>
<h1>Challenge: Consistency across channels and agents</h1>
<p>Another global service complaint is having to repeat problems. Over 65% of customers are frustrated by having to contact a company multiple times for the same reason, and 55% are frustrated by having to repeat their problem to multiple agents across multiple channels.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">German customers</a> expect a unified approach to customer service.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.itweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=67603" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Almost 90% of South Africans</a> are frustrated by being transferred multiple times (much higher than the global average of 66%), and 64% are frustrated by having to repeat themselves to multiple agents.</li>
<li><a href="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nearly half of French customers</a> (48%) expect to be able to reach the same agent regardless of channel.</li>
<li><a href="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">80% of Britons</a> think companies are focused on selling across multiple channels than providing a seamless experience for customers.</li>
<li><a href="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Over 40% of Australian customers</a> think they should be able to contact the same agent regardless of channel.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solution: Automatic updates.</h2>
<p><a href="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Almost 90% of global customers</a> think companies should provide an omnichannel experience, meaning that they should be able to switch between channels and agents without losing context. With a cloud-based communication platform that automatically updates, service agents will be able to see the person a customer last talked to and the last channel they used, then pick up the conversation where it left off.</p>
<h1>Challenge: Unfriendly service representatives</h1>
<p>Another universal customer service complaint is about service representatives, with <a href="http://www.parature.com/2013-customer-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">60% of global customers</a> ranking it as a top frustration. Customer service agents sometimes lose their temper, which can lead to fractured customer relationships and massive media fallout. However, the gold standard across the world is to treat the customer in a friendly manner, though the method varies from country to country.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the United States, employees usually treat the customer in a <a href="http://www.parature.com/2013-customer-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">genial manner</a> and try and work with customers to solve their problem.</li>
<li>In some <a href="http://www.parature.com/2013-customer-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">northern European countries</a>, agents can be direct and use phrases like “Your idea is wrong” with customers.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.berlitz.com.uy/SiteData/docs/BerlitzCul/691862a1aef0a178/Berlitz_Culture&amp;CustomerServiceExperience.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Representatives in Asian countries</a> typically limit themselves to a small smile, but take personal responsibility in solving a customer’s problem.</li>
<li><a href="http://graphics.eiu.com/upload/customerservice_DHL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thai consumers</a> are pleased by courteous, knowledgeable staff more than Malaysian or South Korean customers.</li>
<li>In South Africa, <a href="http://www.tourism.gov.za/AboutNDT/Publications/tourism%20report%20final%2028%20january%202011_22%20march.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">good service</a> is built on personal and emotional connections. Emotionally detached agents lead to a bad service experience.</li>
<li>A 2015 customer service survey found that <a href="http://www.itnewsafrica.com/2015/04/nigeria-mobile-users-unimpressed-with-customer-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">almost 50% of mobile phone users</a> in South Africa, Nigeria, Germany, Spain, Poland, and Morocco were dissatisfied with the customer service agents they spoke to.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solution: Training</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.parature.com/2013-customer-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One of the top six global customer service frustrations </a>is dealing with employees or self-service sites that can’t answer questions. Companies that train their agents to be knowledgeable, culturally sensitive and technologically savvy will reap the rewards&#8211;<a href="http://graphics.eiu.com/upload/customerservice_DHL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 65% of companies in the Asia Pacific</a> region reported that staff training had the most impact on customer satisfaction. By training agents to be able to work on multiple channels or use a CRM, companies will be able to provide agents with a great customer experience the world over.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Providing great global customer service is a daunting task, as not staying attuned to global customers’ service preferences can have significant repercussions. Poor customer service costs companies <a href="http://www.parature.com/2013-customer-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$83 billion</a> every year, and companies without an omnichannel strategy lose an average of <a href="http://www.parature.com/2013-customer-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$22 million</a>. In addition, a <a href="http://trendwatching.com/trends/future-customer-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2013 Accenture Survey </a>found that 66% of global consumers stopped doing business one brand and switched to another due to poor customer service, while 82% say the company could have done something to stop them from switching.</p>
<p>Global customers are also not opposed to voicing their grievances after a bad service experience. <a href="ttps://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Over 40% of French customers</a> will tell friends and family about a bad service experience, impacting future purchase decisions. Similarly, <a href="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 40% of Australian customers</a> will share bad service experiences with friends and family, and 13% will go on social media.</p>
<p>However, global consumers will reward companies for a good experience. <a href="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Over 80% of Australian</a> customers will use a brand again if they have a good experience, and 41% will spend more money with that company. For more and more consumers, a good experience is an omnichannel one: <a href="https://www.avaya.com/usa/documents/media-summary-for-avaya-cem-global-november-2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 25% of global consumers</a> are using more channels to contact organizations. Companies that provide an omnichannel experience, <a href="https://www.avaya.com/usa/documents/media-summary-for-avaya-cem-global-november-2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">45% of global consumers will spend more money with them</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it&#8217;s important to be able to communicate effectively to your customers no matter where they are. By familiarizing themselves with global customer preferences and multiple support channels, service representatives can make a world of difference.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Customer service stories often surface in a negative light—a service wasn’t cancelled, no one responded to a problem, or a company didn’t deliver on its promise. In fact, <a href="http://www.desk.com/customer-service/excellent-customer-service">nearly one-third of consumers</a> think that businesses are paying less attention to providing great customer service.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, the customer is always right about this. While <a href="http://www.helpscout.net/75-customer-service-facts-quotes-statistics/">over 80% of companies</a> boast that they provide &#8220;superior&#8221; customer service, only 8% of customers actually agree with them.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s a company to do?</p>
<p><span id="more-7249"></span>Invest in and provide a good service experience, for the good of your customers (and your company).</p>
<p>At OneReach, we think great customer service isn&#8217;t just about the channels you use&#8211;it&#8217;s about making service on any channel effortless, intuitive and available any time. Companies that invest in great customer service, be it through their contact centers, help pages, or self-service initiatives, can increase customer satisfaction, customer loyalty, and even save money.</p>
<p>Check out these customer service statistics to see the power of a positive customer service experience (and what happens when companies aren’t providing it).</p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having observed dozens of providers and staff members in their natural work environment, we have seen and heard a lot. But some of the personal stories that we’ve heard are hard to forget and worth sharing. These stories shed light on the truth about healthcare communications and the workflows of these dedicated, and often over-worked, staff members.</p>
<p><span id="more-7187"></span>For example, a back-office administrator once told me that on a daily basis he would leave his desk and go sit in his car in order to escape the incessant ringing of the office telephone. Let’s think about that- the sheer volume of phone calls to this office is enough to drive the employee off premises. If we consider leaving the office to be the extreme end of the spectrum, think about how much stress and dissatisfaction occurred along the way to that breaking point. Imagine how that stress manifests itself. Is it fair to ask that employee to provide a high level of service for all 200 calls that he needs to take in a day? Could you provide a high level of service if you had to take a phone call from a patient ever 2 minutes for your 8 hour shift? And what about the voicemail queue that is building? And the additional paperwork that is also part of your job description?</p>
<p>Another example was a staff member who told me that it often took 2-3 phone calls to complete the rescheduling of an appointment. Why? Because 80% of the time the patient did not answer their call. When the patient calls back, the staff member was on the other line so the patient left a voicemail. It takes several rounds of “phone tag” to actually connect. That is inherently a problem with synchronous communications (see this <a href="http://www.hl7standards.com/blog/2013/08/22/healthcares-new-os-shifting-health-communications-from-a-liability-to-an-asset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>article </b></a>for the benefits of using asynchronous communication technologies), and is compounded in larger offices that have multiple staff members answering the phone (“But I just spoke with Sam about rescheduling my appointment! What do you mean I have to hold on…”).</p>
<p>The truth is these employees are being told by their bosses that they need to create a positive patient experience, but often are not given the support and tools they need to be successful. Another way to think about it is to understand that <b>staff satisfaction is directly related to patient satisfaction</b>. One practice told us that all of their negative reviews on <a href="http://www.onereachhealth.com/patients-are-shopping-are-you-on-their-list/"><b>social rating sites</b></a> (Yelp! HealthGrades, etc.) had nothing to do with the doctor or the care their patients received, but focused on the administrative challenges their patients had (the waiting room experience, trouble making appointments, lack of communication, etc.).</p>
<p>So who’s to blame? It’s hard to blame the doctors- after all, many of them just want to practice medicine. And it’s hard to blame the practice administrators- they can’t help that the phone is the front door to their practice, and they often can’t afford to hire yet another employee- that’s an expensive way to scale a business. So maybe it is our fault- the technology companies who work in this space. Despite all of the innovation in healthcare (especially in diagnostics and imaging), we have neglected the primary way that patients and their care team communicate- through the telephone.</p>
<p>OneReach is working hard to lead the way and create change that will enhance the patient experience, improve the lives of staff members, help to reduce the costs of healthcare, and ultimately contribute to better health outcomes. <a href="http://www.onereachhealth.com">Let us know if you want to help us, or if we can help you</a>. We are in this together. After all, we are patients, too.</p>

		<title>Want to Increase Customer Satisfaction? Use Text Messaging</title>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">On an ordinary day in most places in the industrialized world you can see hoards of people buried in their phones, fingers flying away typing out text messages to one another. Texting has become a primary means of communication these days, particularly among younger demographics who have had texting available most of their life.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span id="more-7175"></span>The Business Problem</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Businesses sometimes lag behind the rest of society when it comes to adopting technology. It seems that the corporate world is quite fine with maintaining communication through e-mail, but has often not yet embraced a <a href="http://www.onereach.com/">text-enable</a> model. Part of the problem may be that businesses still accept the stigma that text messaging is immature and only used for very casual social conversations. Instead of accepting this false notion, they should listen to what the customers want, and the customers want to text businesses.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Internet Based Options</h2>
<p dir="ltr">What if your customer base is not one of the most mobile connected types of people out there? No problem! There are other options in the form of Internet based chat services that can be provided. Call centers are often avoided by customers who don&#8217;t want to have to deal with the hassle of placing the call. If that same customer can simply log online and chat with someone via their computer, they may be more likely to take that option. This helps more customers get their questions answered, and that is always a goal to shoot for.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Draw In Leads With SMS Texting</h2>
<p dir="ltr">If you are happy with the first two ideas, you should be positively thrilled with the idea of using SMS text messaging to draw in more leads. The fact of the matter is that traditional means of getting leads (holding events for example) is highly expensive. Contrast that with the very low cost of SMS messages, and you can see why it is a better method to use. Also, SMS messages have high read through rates, and that means more eyes on what you are trying to promote.</p>
