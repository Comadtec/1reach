								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July of 2013 Toby Shapshak, the South African speaker, strategist and editor of Stuff Magazine, did a TED talk called </span><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/toby_shapshak_you_don_t_need_an_app_for_that?language=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You Don’t Need An App For That</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Business leaders, innovators and experience designers would soon realize how profound this TED talk was to the rest of the world. Shapshak’s astute observations and message to the rest of the world was years ahead of a revolution that Forbes would call </span><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2016/02/23/chat-bots-facebook-telegram-wechat/#5c9ad9142633"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“the new way we’ll be interacting with computers.”</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toby’s 2013 Ted talk touted that “while the rest of the world is updating statuses and playing games on smartphones, Africa is developing useful SMS-based solutions to everyday needs”. Since 2013 his TED talk has been viewed 1,438,046 times as of July 19, 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward a couple of years and we see more apps than anyone knows what to do with, as well as a notable decrease in</span><a href="http://onereach.com/blog/infographic-mobile-apps-vs-text-messaging/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> usage and app-downloads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This has businesses confused and frustrated. Meanwhile, around the world, messaging (SMS and the ever-encroaching uptake of IP messaging &#8211; Facebook Messenger, Spark, Slack, Kik, SnapChat, etc) is by far the most used function or app on mobile phones &#8211; smart phone or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2016 brought a wave of new businesses and products that fall into the category of </span><a href="http://onereach.com/blog/why-your-business-needs-a-bot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; chat bots, messaging-bots, </span><a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/humans-ai-and-the-user-interface-of-the-future"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conversational-bots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “invisible apps” or &#8220;conversational commerce”. Messaging-bots are popping up for everything, increasingly displacing mobile-apps. New bots are being brought to life daily by startups and household brands alike. Whether the experiences are where they need to be or not, bots existing today which allow you to order a </span><a href="http://onereach.com/blog/i-tried-ordering-dominos-over-text-message-and-it-was-a-total-disaster/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pizza</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, make a payment, read the </span><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/04/media/new-york-times-text-message/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, be reminded of an appointment or even make an appointment. Even </span><a href="http://onereach.com/blog/cities-offer-text-311/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">city and county municipalities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are seeing the value, for example, Washington DC uses a </span><a href="https://onereach.com/bots/#dc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bot for their 311</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">-public services hotline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silicon Valley and other capital ventures hubs around the world have already backed several startups that leverage, if not rely entirely on, bots. Benedict Evans, Partner at the Venture Capital Firm, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz (&#8216;</span><a href="http://www.a16z.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a16z</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeted &#8220;I genuinely can&#8217;t remember the last time a concept blew up as quickly as bots&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, I’ve been part of a business that, like Toby Shapshak, was ahead of the “bot” curve that’s now consuming the business and customer experience worlds. Expedia, Bosch, DHL, Unilever, Stella Artois, HomeAdvisor, The National Domestic Violence Hotline, Red Cross and many others use </span><a href="http://t.yesware.com/tt/40cc1fc6e25c0e6b6c473b6e5d7078c28afa0f2a/489eb37184cda59ba3c43d567cdd0d3e/ac7788ed6176abd000e4ebc066e9c752/l.gbtrck.com/1ab15380-e2b7-425a-9ad9-959cef88b9b1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OneReach</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create (and manage) self-service messaging bots and live communications with their customers. The most popular use-cases include live and automated customer support, proactive order status notifications or order updates, payments/purchasing and text or chat-enabled IVRs (now called chat-bots). Who’d have thought that a bot could reduce 40% of a major brand’s customer support costs, increase revenue by 30% or boost NPS scores?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toby Shapshak seems to have been the oracle that foretold one of the most prolific changes in how consumers and businesses communicate and do commerce. He suggested that bots are “effectively an intersection of the most basic and sophisticated communication. It&#8217;s remarkable that the very rich (in the developed world) and poor (in the developing world) have effectively ended up in the same place (both using bots)”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Years have past since his Ted Talk and we thought it would be valuable to see what Toby thinks of today’s climate and where things go from here. </span></p>
<h2><b>Our interview with Toby Shapshak</b></h2>
<p><b>Elias: </b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Messenger Bots are impacting the everyday life and habits of consumers &#8211; in commerce, purchasing, managing one’s time, getting news and so on. You’ve been watching the impact of messenger bots in Africa for sometime. With this in mind, what perspective would you offer to business leaders and experience-designers on the impact that messenger bots have on consumer habits &#8211; in commerce and purchasing or donations, customer support, managing one’s time, getting news and so on?</span></i></p>
<p><b>Toby:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Business leaders and UX designers should be aware of how chatbots can have an impact on consumer habits; both positively and negatively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the youth of the world, who have grown up using chat, it&#8217;s a logical extension to communicate through this channel, ask questions, even make purchases. Pew Research found that American teenagers were only using email to communicate with &#8220;authority figures&#8221; &#8211; adults, parents and teachers. Now chatting is so dominant that WhatsApp has over a 1 billion users and Facebook Messenger has some 800 million users and 50 million businesses. WeChat has some 800 million users, mostly in China, and has been using bots in a very sophisticated way for a lot longer. Wechat is the future of chatting mingled with commerce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The great thing about SMS &#8211; which is arguably the greatest communication medium the world has ever seen; and the most expensive &#8211; is that it works on every single cellphone, no matter how sophisticated. The other key thing is SMS has a 100% read rate &#8211; even the spam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this context, doing new things like search or shopping via messaging/chat seems obvious to a generation of youngsters that prefer chat to email or anything else. Chat is cheaper and it&#8217;s a paradigm that people understand. It also doesn&#8217;t have a learning curve, the way that conventional apps do. </span></p>
<p><b>Elias: </b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013 you commented that &#8220;while the rest of the world is updating statuses and playing games on smartphones, Africa is developing useful SMS-based solutions to everyday needs”. Is the current wave of messenger bots solving real problems or this just the new version of &#8220;updating statuses and playing games on smartphones”?</span></i></p>
<p><b>Toby: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, a lot of chatbots seem like a nice-to-have. Give them some maturity and we&#8217;ll see if they are a flash-in-the-pan hype or something that will be continuingly useful.</span></p>
<p><b>Elias: </b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the rest of the world catching up or is Africa still ahead and in what ways? What has the rest of the world yet to learn still from African innovation?</span></i></p>
<p><b>Toby: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa is forced to innovate the way it does because there are no other alternatives. it&#8217;s the purest form of innovation out of necessity. More people in Africa have access to a cellphone than to electricity. Because of this there are brilliant power solutions, including solar-power systems like M-Kopa. If you have a pressing problem, it&#8217;s the best incentive in the world to solve it. If you have electricity, what are you likely to do? Watch TV or YouTube. it&#8217;s sadly that simple.</span></p>
<p><b>Elias: </b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are your predictions for where messaging and bots go next, in Africa and elsewhere?</span></i></p>
<p><b>Toby: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sky really is the limit, isn&#8217;t it. Text-based services are revolutionary in Africa, offering everything from Google search via SMS to important health information via South Africa&#8217;s mHealth initiatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin Kelly, the founding executive editor of Wired magazine, said some very interesting things at SXSW this year about how artificial intelligence will become part of our lives. Right now, he says, “it&#8217;s like the early days of cloud computing, but it will ultimately be as sophisticated a service as cloud-based offerings are now”. He called it &#8220;intelligence as a services&#8221;. “Like electricity, which you now buy in what we now call an on-demand model”, Kelly says &#8220;you won’t have to make your AI, you will just purchase it. It will flow like electricity from the grid to wherever you want it. &#8221; He says: &#8220;Artificial intelligence will soon be a commodity&#8221;. AI services at low cost will spur the chatbot industry and make offerings increasingly sophisticated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also the network effect to consider. Part of the reason Google&#8217;s search algorithms are so fast &#8211; and can predict or suggest answers so quickly &#8211; is because of the volume of search queries it has already performed. This inventory of queries and searches mean there is a greater volume of info to reference. As the volume of chatbot data increases, they will also become more effective.</span></p>
<h2><b>Reflection &amp; Looking Forward</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reflecting on Toby Shapshak’s 2013 Ted Talk it’s evident that he saw something revolutionary emerging amidst the noise in the world of experience design, business and technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to the concept of hindsight being 20/20, until 2016 the business world largely ignored the opportunity to leverage the most ubiquitous communication channels in the world (text messaging and IP messaging) for customer support. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/edn-moments/4402146/1st-text-message-is-sent--December-3--1992"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first text message was sent in 1992</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by 2007 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">74% of all mobile phone users worldwide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used text messaging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It took the western business world roughly another 10 years to accept the notion that just maybe they should consider communicating with their customers over the single most prefered communication channel in the world &#8211; SMS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the last 6 years at </span><a href="http://www.onereach.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OneReach,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I’ve been lucky enough to see startups and huge international brands alike use our tools to easily create and iterate on fully reportable and integrated bots. It’s been 3 years since Toby Shapshak’s TED talk and it’s great to finally see so many companies designing for the channels consumers actually prefer (messaging). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we’re here, let’s not be foolish enough to think that leveraging chat bots to drive business impact is any easier because the interface is an ‘old’ technology. The businesses world learned that building any old mobile app really isn’t all that hard. Similar to mobile apps, the success of a today’s chat bots will not be defined by whether or not your company offers chatbots. Success will rest on whether or not your chatbot experiences achieve desired outcomes for your business while being meaningful to your customer.</span></p>

<p>In today’s world, customer service is no longer restricted to a simple phone call. A recent report from<a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Global-Microsites/CCBenchmarking"> Dimension Data</a> found that <i>digital</i> interactions account for 35% of all contact center interactions.</p>
<p>In fact, customers are so vested in the idea of emerging channels that contact centers have ranked it their number one priority. As digital use climbs, nearly 75% of contact centers predict an increase in non-voice interactions within two years. Over 40% expect a decrease in voice traffic in that same time period.</p>
<p>Some of this digital dominance can be attributed to smartphones, which have exploded in popularity over the past few years.<a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/#smartphones">According to Pew Research</a>, over 64% of American adults now own a smartphone, up from 35% in 2011. But it’s not just limited to the U.S.—one in five people across the globe own a smartphone.</p>
<p><span id="more-2279"></span>Global smartphone users typically spend 2 hours and 30 minutes a day on their phone, trumping<a href="http://bgr.com/2014/05/29/smartphone-computer-usage-study-chart/"> tablets, computers and even television</a> for the most time spent in front of a screen. Smartphones are also dominating the connected device market, and are predicted to surpass<a href="http://www.statista.com/chart/777/global-connected-device-shipments/"> 1.7 billion units</a> in global sales by 2017.</p>
<p>And customers are certainly app happy—there are<a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/2014-mobile-landscape-25-statistics-will-drive-future-mobile-marketing-infographic/89507/"> 224 million active app users</a> in the U.S, a little over 70% of the population. And over<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/01/mobile-app-usage-increases-in-2014-as-mobile-web-surfing-declines/">85% of time spent</a> on a smartphone is spent in apps.</p>
<p>But let’s break this down a little bit.</p>
<h2>Why Your Mobile Strategy Can’t Rely on Apps Alone</h2>
<p>Of the 85% of time spent in apps, <a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/">32% of this is games and 18% is Facebook</a>. The rest of the time is broken up between news, productivity, and other apps (see below). And while it’s true that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2011/oct/28/branded-apps">91% of top brands</a> have an app, unless you’re a big hitter like Facebook or Amazon, you’re going to have a hard time getting a customer’s attention.</p>
<p>Part of this is because <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/21/majority-of-digital-media-consumption-now-takes-place-in-mobile-apps/">42% of all app time</a> spent on smartphones takes place within an individual’s most-used app, and 75% of time is spent in their top 4 apps. For the average person, those are most likely going to be social networking apps and games. Think about it–what are the most commonly used apps on your phone?</p>
<p>In addition, apps aren’t exactly a high-earning channel for companies. Gartner predicted that<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2615270/mobile-apps/gartner--93-percent-of-all-mobile-apps-will-be-free-by-2016.html"> 93% of mobile apps</a> will be free by 2016, and for those apps that do generate revenue Apple and Google also take a 30% cut. Granted, most enterprise apps are free for existing customers, but creating these apps can be a time-consuming process that cost an average of <a href="http://resources.kinvey.com/docs/State+of+Enterprise+Mobility+Survey+2014+-+Kinvey.pdf">$270,000</a> to develop and deploy Creating apps for different platforms (iOS, Android, even Blackberry) and deploying regular updates can significantly increase costs.</p>
<p>For companies that do develop an app, there’s no guarantee that customers will use them. Four out of five customers spend most of their time in<a href="http://marketingland.com/report-mobile-users-spend-80-percent-time-just-five-apps-116858"> their top five apps</a>, meaning a service app may be overlooked altogether. Customers may have 30-40 apps installed on their phone, but Google research found customers only use<a href="https://think.withgoogle.com/mobileplanet/en/downloads/"> about 12 of those apps</a> within a 30-day period.</p>
<p>And apps aren’t always guaranteed to work—according to Pew Research,<a href="https://info.dynatrace.com/rs/compuware/images/Mobile_App_Survey_Report.pdf"> over 50% of consumers</a> have experienced a problem with a mobile app. But, perhaps the most worrisome fact for businesses is that<a href="https://info.dynatrace.com/rs/compuware/images/Mobile_App_Survey_Report.pdf"> 79% of consumers</a> will only retry an app once or twice before abandoning it. Despite the fact that every day over 50 million mobile apps are downloaded, <a href="http://www.nuance.com/ucmprod/groups/enterprise/@web-enus/documents/collateral/nc_020218.pdf">95% are abandoned</a> within a month.</p>
<p>The good news is that you don’t have to rely on an app to provide great customer service or self-service.</p>
<h2>Why Texting Needs to Be Part of Your Mobile Strategy</h2>
<p>A recent study by <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/#smartphones">Pew Research</a> found that text messaging is “the most widely-used smartphone feature.” Not only do 97% of American smartphone owners use text messaging, but they use it more frequently than any other channel. On a global scale, 90% of people text at least once a day, sending over<a href="http://www.openuniversity.edu/news/news/2014-text-messaging-usage-statistics"> 11 billion texts daily</a>. With usage like this, why haven’t more businesses picked it up?</p>
<p>To their credit, some businesses have. Over<a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Global-Microsites/CCBenchmarking"> 37% of contact centers offer SMS</a>, with 23% planning to add it in the coming year.</p>
<p>Your company can begin adopting text messaging using these following steps:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Guide agents on proper use.</li>
<li>Integrate it with other channels.</li>
<li>Decide between long codes and short codes.</li>
<li>Find a balance between automation and live agents.</li>
<li>Identify text support targets.</li>
<li>Create text support discovery mechanisms.</li>
<li>Identify what success looks like.</li>
<li>Recognize customer problems.</li>
<li>Have a customer experience plan.</li>
<li>Create a text support rollout plan.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>Companies that have adopted texting have received an overwhelmingly positive response from customers. Customers shipping packages with UPS or FedEx can opt-in to receive automated texts that track their shipment and medical organizations can send patients reminders about when they should take their medication. Contact centers can send customers personalized texts based on service history and past interactions, increasing customer satisfaction.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Apps are a highly-used communication channel, but for most businesses, the upfront cost and predominant use of gaming/social apps don’t justify the investment. That’s why texting is such an essential part of your mobile strategy–it can do almost anything apps can do. It’s fast, it can be professional but personal, it’s easy to use, it’s in real-time, it picks up where you left off, it connects to the Internet, etc. There are some situations where an app will work better, and that’s okay. But before you move ahead with a mobile app, ask yourself one question:</p>
<p><i>Can I use text for that?</i></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This guest post is written by Olga Grigorenko, a freelance writer for <a href="http://fueled.com">Fueled</a>.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can all remember the days when we memorized our friends’ numbers, carefully recorded new contacts in address books, and coquettishly wrote down our digits on party napkins. Telephones were lifelines and phone calls were indispensable. But then </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mobile</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> phones happened, and our means of communication changed drastically. Exchanging contact information became far more simplified and reaching anyone over the phone became significantly easier. Phone calls could now be made on the go &#8211; anywhere, anytime.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-7426"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1970, mobile phones were installed into cars and just three years later, Motorola produced the first handheld mobile phone. The network of wireless towers built to service these mobile phones was arranged in what was called a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cellular layout</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, due to its close resemblance to a biological cell. Mobile phones used on this cellular network were soon simply called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cellular phones</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">; while </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cellular</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mobile</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are not technically synonymous, they’ve become completely interchangeable in the common vernacular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, wireless phones have developed into devices more comparable to computers than telephones, a factor evident not only in their capabilities, but in our usage of them. Mobile phones are now used for taking pictures, sending emails, <a href="https://fueled.com/">using apps</a>, and listening to music. So when exactly did we stop using our mobile devices as phones and why is it that we still call them </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">phones?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact of the matter is that the ways in which we communicate with each other have changed, and our mobile phones have changed accordingly. Physical phone calls occur less often because they limit us to one task at a time, while texting allows us the freedom to simultaneously listen to music, draft a work email, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">also</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> post on Instagram. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, all of these advanced capabilities were added onto the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cell phone</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and not vice versa. This perhaps, is the only reason we still call our mobile devices cell phones, and it’s very likely that this may change in the future. There are many other phrases that have managed to outlive their literal meaning. We </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">type</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but not on typewriters; we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">rewind</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> things that weren’t unwound; we listen to internet </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">radio</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that doesn’t run on radio waves; we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CC</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Carbon Copy) people on emails when there’s no carbon paper on our desks. So the question arises: what exactly should we be calling these devices that we carelessly carry around in our pockets?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a few decades, what we now call </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">phones</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be able to execute amazing feats &#8211; like supporting photorealistic games, or substituting personalized med packs. As these devices and our use of them continue to evolve, so will our terminology for them. There is no doubt that the ways in which we communicate with each other will continue to change, but our essential human need for communication and contact will remain the same.</span></p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Through the history of the Internet, we’ve seen a bots of all flavors (scrapers, viruses, worms), all often giving bots a bad name. They’re small bits of code that can carry out a host of malicious actions&#8211;stealing web content, screwing up web analytics, and encouraging click fraud.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This all sounds pretty dire, but more recently, the concept of bots has been harnessed for more and more good. And one of its new and improved forms is  conversational SMS bots.</span><span id="more-7406"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what precipitated their rise? Well, there’s a whole movement spawning from the concept that “You don’t need an app for that.”  Back in 2013, South African technology writer and TED speaker Toby Shapshak </span><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/toby_shapshak_you_don_t_need_an_app_for_that?language=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gave a talk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> extolling the virtues of mobile, calling it “the gold of today,” and highlighting how Africans are using SMS in particular to innovate and solve problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to learn how to get the most milk from your cow? Join iCow’s texting program. Want to use SMS for mobile commerce? Try M-PESA. It’s so powerful, in fact, that as Shapshak explains:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something like 25 million dollars a day is transacted through M-Pesa. Forty percent of Kenya&#8217;s GDP moves through M-Pesa using [feature phones].”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems like now the U.S. is finally catching up with Africa on the use of SMS for business, putting its own Silicon Valley, bot-powered spin on things. </span><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/06/assist-bot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> even cited 2016 as the year of the chat bot, citing conversational SMS bot </span><a href="http://www.assi.st/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Assist lets you text in for a variety of different tasks&#8211;getting a ride, sending flowers, ordering food, etc. It seems simple enough, but this company has taken Silicon Valley by storm, drawing in over </span><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/06/assist-bot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$5.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in seed funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, similar to during the great American gold rush, if you’re going jump on this wave and contribute an awesome conversational SMS bot to the business world or to consumers, you’ll need the right tools. Maybe you can code and have time, or maybe you can code but don’t have time. More likely, you’re part of the majority that can’t code and doesn’t have time. Either way, here’s an off-the shelf tool that will make your SMS-bot-dreams suddenly more real. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wait, “SMS bot-dreams”? Did we just make up a new term?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OneReach has  created the perfect tool for this important moment, wherein the world is harnessing bots for good &#8211; conversational bots that help businesses and consumers to get what they need.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve created software that makes it easy, fast and affordable for anyone to create conversational phone or SMS bots that can do almost anything &#8211; it all comes down to what you program them to do. And the best part is that no coding is required and it’s all automatically reportable (sounds like a lie, I know). So when I say anyone can create their own conversational SMS or voice app, I really mean it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bots are hot and they’re  where the communication conversation is heading this year. Whether you’re replacing a mobile app with clever automated SMS, or putting automated (or live) SMS concierge service in place for a boutique hotel, OneReach just made it way easier to create your SMS bot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve got “SMS bot dreams” &#8211; simple or complex &#8211; I’d love to take on the challenge of seeing how easy OneReach makes it to bring your vision to life.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we look back on 2015, it’s tempting to refer to that age-old adage: “The more things change, the more things stay the same.”</p>
<p>This year, that couldn’t be further from the truth.</p>
<p>That’s because 2015 was the year the technology really made its presence known in customer service. Automation, artificial intelligence, social media, CRM integrations, texting&#8211;all were major customer service trends in 2015.</p>
<h2><span id="more-7370"></span><strong>Customer Service Trends in 2015</strong></h2>
<p>2015 was the year that:</p>
<p><strong>Customer service got smart.</strong> This year, artificial intelligence wasn’t just limited to the realms of science fiction a la Age of Ultron—it was also slowly incorporated into different companies’ service offerings. Amazon made its entry into the home automation market with Alexa, a virtual assistant that can field questions ranging from the time of day to traffic predictions to good restaurants nearby. On the enterprise-level side, IBM continued to expand the capabilities of Jeopardy-winning Watson, adding self-service into varied industries like healthcare, education and finance, among others.</p>
<p><strong>Customer service got automated.</strong> Over <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">55% of customers</a> would like a self-service experience, which provides businesses with the unique opportunity to speed up the customer experience while decreasing costs. In the restaurant industry, established chains like Outback Steakhouse and Olive Garden let customers <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Saving-Money/2015/0514/Restaurant-table-tablets-A-gimmick-or-actually-helpful" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">order via tablets</a>, while market newcomer <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/09/upshot/restaurant-of-the-future-service-with-an-impersonal-touch.html?_r=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eatsa</a> automated the bulk of the food delivery process. Automated self-service also extended to digital channels—companies like <a href="http://www.toistersolutions.com/blog/2015/10/28/automation-fail-how-attcares-stumbled-into-a-tweet-chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AT&amp;T</a> automated social media responses (not always with the best outcome), while <a href="https://www.twilio.com/customers/stories/uber" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uber</a>, Snooze and more texted customers about the status of their ride or table.</p>
<p><strong>Customer service got focused.</strong> Over 80% of companies want to use <a href="https://fonolo.com/blog/2013/09/17-important-customer-experience-statistics-for-the-call-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customer service</a> as a way to differentiate themselves from their competition. But what defines a good customer service experience? In 2015, we interviewed over 60 industry influencers and found that the best way to <a href="http://onereach.com/resources/customer-service-report-2015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improve customer service</a> was to focus on the employee experience. By focusing on employees and treating them with respect, companies can ensure that they pass that goodwill onto customers. Case in point: <a href="https://jobs.zappos.com/why-zappos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zappos</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/about/careers/lifeatgoogle/benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Customer service got diversified.</strong> In 2015, companies made an effort to diversify their service offerings, providing support on established and emerging channels.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mobile.</strong> In 2015, companies increasingly relied on mobile to interact with their customers. This year saw the official launch of Apple Pay, Starbucks’ continued success with mobile app <a href="http://www.nfcworld.com/2015/07/24/336798/one-in-five-starbucks-sales-in-the-us-made-with-mobile-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">payments</a> (more than $9 million in orders processed per week) and Magic’s simple but powerful text concierge service. As mentioned above, more and more companies saw the value of adding texting to their support strategy, making it easier for customers to contact them on a channel they prefer. However, not every attempt to implement mobile customer service was successful—Domino’s unfortunately disappointed some customers with the rollout of its text-to-order service.</p>
<p><strong>Video.</strong> Audiovisual communication has been popular among consumers for years, but 2015 was the year when video really started to gain a foothold in B2C interactions. Amazon’s Mayday is probably the most well-known example, but <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/28/this-is-webrtcs-yearor-is-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Express</a> and other companies helped customers solve their problems over video. WebRTC’s open source nature also made it easier for any company to incorporate video into their service offering.</p>
<p><strong>Social.</strong> 2015 was the year social platforms got serious about customer service interactions. <a href="https://twitter.app.box.com/customer-service-on-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>released a customer service playbook outlining the benefits of using social for customer service, as well as how to apply it to an organization. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/15/facebook-pages-can-now-show-how-quickly-they-respond-to-customers-messages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> also launched a new feature that keeps track of how long it takes company pages to respond to customer messages, giving customers better insight into the responsiveness of an organization. This is especially important, given the fact that over 40% of customers expect a response on <a href="http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-research/42-percent-of-consumers-complaining-in-social-media-expect-60-minute-response-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social</a> in 60 minutes or less.</p>
<p><strong>Voice.</strong> Voice is still king in contact center service interactions, but times are changing. Research from<a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dimension Data</a> found that while voice accounts for 65% of all contact center interactions, digital interactions will surpass voice by the end of 2017. And with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/07/technology/tech-companies-leave-phone-calls-behind.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet-based companies</a> making a concerted attempt to direct customers towards digital, with other companies ditching corporate <a href="http://www.inc.com/associated-press/jpmorgan-chase-getting-rid-of-voicemail-for-some-employees.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">voicemail</a>, it became very clear in that businesses couldn’t just rely on voice for communication.</p>
<p><strong>Web chat</strong>. Over 70% of contact centers will offer web chat by the end of 2016, up from just 33% in 2015. There are several reasons why companies would want to invest in web chat—it’s cheaper than voice, agents can handle multiple conversations at once and respond in real-time, etc. And there’s a reason companies from Nordstrom to Nike are using web chat to interact with customers—while 91% of customers are happy with web chat’s ability to solve customer support issues, 62% of customers are more inclined to buy a product if live chat is available.</p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>Looking ahead to 2016</strong></h2>
<p>2015 was an exciting year for customer service, with lots of progress made in digital interactions and automation. 2016 is set to be an equally exciting year, if not more so, as companies continue to build on the advances made in 2015. We can’t say for sure what will happen in customer service in 2016, but we’ve got a few ideas.</p>
<p>Below are our customer service predictions for 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Continued rise in cloud computing</strong>. In 2016, businesses will continue to migrate to the <a href="http://www.icmi.com/Resources/Technology/2014/05/Is-the-Cloud-Contact-Center-Passing-You-By" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloud</a> for its accessibility, storage, simplicity, and security, among other benefits. In fact, 88% of businesses are currently using the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2015/03/04/new-stats-from-the-state-of-cloud-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public cloud</a>. In addition, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2015/09/27/roundup-of-cloud-computing-forecasts-and-market-estimates-q3-update-2015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner</a> predicts that by 2020, roughly 25% of organizations will use cloud-based CRMs. Cloud-based software-as-a-service, or <a href="http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/technology/publications/global-software-100-leaders/saas-trends.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SaaS</a>, will also become more prevalent, growing at a rate of 21.3% per year and making up 14.2% of software spending. <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/273642/worldwide-software-as-a-service-revenue-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SaaS revenue</a> is predicted to hit $32.8 billion in revenue in 2016, up 17% from 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Delivering on the omnichannel promise. </strong>In 2013, <a href="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zendesk </a>research found that over 85% of customers thought companies needed to do a better job of providing a seamless experience. In 2015, companies were on the right track but weren’t quite there yet—nearly 50% of contact centers named integration of Web, contact center and CRM systems as their top challenge, with <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">integration</a> of systems to enable channel hopping close behind (41%). We predict that in 2016, companies will continue to take steps toward providing an omnichannel experience. Companies will find and use service platforms that manage and can integrate with multiple service channels/CRMs and similar systems.</p>
<p><strong>Personalization.</strong> This trend is a combination of the previous two trends—cloud services will enable companies to provide a personalized experience across channels. We predict that the ability to integrate customer data into service interactions will become increasingly mainstream in 2016, both in response to <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/07/14/consumers-want-privacy-yet-demand-personalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consumer demand</a> and a desire to differentiate on great <a href="https://fonolo.com/blog/2013/09/17-important-customer-experience-statistics-for-the-call-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customer experiences</a>. The SaaS pricing model of most cloud services will also make it easy for businesses of any size to provide great customer service.</p>
<p><strong>Proactive customer service.</strong> <a href="http://www.wired.com/insights/2014/11/the-internet-of-things-bigger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Internet of Things</a> is rapidly changing our personal and professional lives. IoT-based companies, but other businesses as well, will leverage customer data to provide a proactive service experience. Although IoT is primarily focused on the B2C experience (think FitBit or any smartfridge), other organizations can learn from IoT innovations. Take, for example, the proactive service experience industry pundits anticipate will take shape in the IoT industry: <a href="http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Web-Exclusives/Viewpoints/Revolutionizing-Customer-Service-with-the-Internet-of-Things-105722.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner</a> predicts that by 2018, five percent of IoT devices will automatically trigger service cases.</p>
<p><strong>More artificial intelligence.</strong> In 2016, AI will continue to get smarter, and its presence in business will continue to grow. This is evidenced by the amount of <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/artificial-intelligence-in-business-the-state-of-play-and-future-prospects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">venture capital</a> being put toward AI-centered businesses, which grew from $75 million in 2013 to $300 million in 2014. And while <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/artificial-intelligence-in-business-the-state-of-play-and-future-prospects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artificial intelligence</a> is primarily being used for voice recognition and response, <a href="http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Editorial/Magazine-Features/The-2015-CRM-Rising-Stars-IBMs-Watson-Brings-Cognitive-Computing-to-Customer-Support-102108.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner</a> predicts that 10% of computers will be able to learn from past interactions by 2017. At OneReach, we’re helping to make this possible through the use of AI in IVRs or self-service.</p>
<p><strong>Moving towards a mobile-first future.</strong> Our world is becoming increasingly mobilized—nearly two billion global citizens now own a <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/2-Billion-Consumers-Worldwide-Smartphones-by-2016/1011694" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smartphone</a>. This mobile change extends to customer service, where 62% of companies think <a href="http://www.icmi.com/About-ICMI/Press-Room/2013-Mobile-Customer-Service-Strategy-Results-Released" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobile service</a> is a competitive differentiator and 64% of customers would prefer to text customer service. Texting is poised to make a big gain in the customer service field, with more than 60% of <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact centers</a>offering it by 2017. In 2016, we predict that companies will continue to provide customer service on mobile devices, whether it’s via text message, mobile applications, mobile websites, or other channels.</p>
<p><strong>More digital/emerging channels.</strong> As mentioned above, customer service interactions will shift to focus on emerging digital channels, both in response to consumer preference and cost savings. Take, for instance, the increased use emerging channels: One in four contact centers will offer <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> by the end of 2017, one in two contact centers will offer a smartphone app by the end of 2017, and three out of five contact centers will offer texting/IM by the end of 2017.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>2015 was a big year for customer service, and 2016 is set to be an even bigger one. We predict that new applications of technology like artificial intelligence and automation will define customer service in the coming years, as they already have today. Companies and contact centers that embrace the customer service trends in 2015 and beyond are poised to make an impact on the market that will be felt for years to come.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The city of Evanston, Ill. has worked with OneReach to provide residents with the ability to check the health inspection scores of local restaurants over text.</p>
<p><span id="more-7369"></span>Diners can text the keyword &#8220;food&#8221; to the city&#8217;s 311 number, and then text the name of the restaurant to see the health inspection score, as well as the date the inspection took place.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.govtech.com/health/Texting-Helps-in-Fight-Against-Foodborne-Illnesses-in-Evanston-Ill.html">Government Technology</a> points out that the use of texting makes getting restaurant scores a lot easier for consumers:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s simple and much easier than Yelp’s mobile app, which compels users to tap and swipe their way to a restaurant’s “More Info” tab and deep dive through a list of miscellaneous information.</p></blockquote>
<p>The food safety text initiative follows the city&#8217;s initiative to local restaurant inspection scores onto Yelp.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile payments have exploded in popularity just within the past year—40% of U.S. consumers have used mobile payments in 2015, compared to just 8% in 2014. In fact,</span><a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/226530/mobile-payment-transaction-volume-forecast/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">mobile transactions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are expected to surpass half a trillion dollars ($560 billion) in 2016, and Gartner predicts that</span><a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2971917"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">mobile commerce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will make of 50% of all U.S. digital commerce by 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why the startling change?</span></p>
<p><span id="more-7361"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of this mobile payment boom can be attributed to the popularity of Near Field Communications (NFC), which uses a specialized receiver to read a chip in customer’s phone. The most well-known examples of NFC are</span><a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/323422/starbucks-mobile-app-transactions-weekly/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Starbucks’ mobile payment app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which manages more than 8 million transactions a week, and ApplePay, whose October 2014 debut even reignited interest in</span><a href="http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/mobile-payment-statistics-1276.php"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">competing mobile pay platforms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like Google Wallet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, mobile payments in the U.S. haven’t seen the success these numbers might lead you to believe.</span><a href="http://www.pymnts.com/in-depth/2015/apple-pay-adoption-improving-but-still-a-long-way-to-go/#.VRFxzu6sVXp"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 80% of iPhone users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> still haven’t tried Apple Pay, and although Starbucks manages millions of transactions a week, they’re just a fraction of the mobile payment market. Mobile money has gained predominance out of circumstance rather than convenience’s sake outside of the U.S., and they’ve seen great success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It turns out the most successful mobile payment company has eschewed mobile apps altogether in favor of something far simpler: the text message.</span></p>
<h2><b>Mobile payments in Africa and the rise of M-Pesa</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies like Magic have already proved that</span><a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/magic-model-instantly-build-sms-concierge-service/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">texting is a great way to pay for things</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but they weren’t the first ones to pioneer this concept. Vodafone had already thought of it first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launched in 2007, M-Pesa (M for mobile, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">pesa</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Swahili word for money) was created by Vodafone for Safaricom and Vodacom as way to</span><a href="http://www.cck.go.ke/news/2012/sector_statistics.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">transfer money over mobile phones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well to serve as a microfinancing service. The service lets users send, receive and deposit money into their accounts, all of which is managed through text messages secured by PIN numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">M-Pesa has grown to become Africa’s mobile payment giant, boasting more than</span><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/28/the-sleeping-giants-of-african-mobile-payments/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">15 million users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and handling US $21 million in transactions every day.</span><a href="http://www.safaricom.co.ke/personal/m-pesa/m-pesa-services"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">M-Pesa users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can</span><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-28061813"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">use the service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make bulk payments</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy Safaricom airtime</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deposit cash into their account</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manage their account</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay bills</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send (transfer) money</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Withdraw money</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay for goods like solar lighting, water, and groceries</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But why the reliance on mobile and text messaging for payments? As Vanessa Clark points out in</span><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/28/the-sleeping-giants-of-african-mobile-payments/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">her Techcrunch article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are three factors that have driven the use of mobile money in Africa:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly…there were fewer than two million mobile phones users in Africa in 1998. This number grew to more than 400 million by 2009…Secondly, there are a large number of unbanked, and underbanked, people in Africa. A 2009 World Bank report puts this figure at as high as 70% of Africans…Finally, much of the continent’s population lives in rural areas, with very little access to banking infrastructure.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proliferation of mobile payments over text message in Africa can’t be understated.</span><a href="http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/04/15/cell-phones-in-africa-communication-lifeline/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 80% of Africans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use their cell phones to text, and 30% use their phone to make and receive payments. This last number more than doubles in Kenya (where M-Pesa originated), with 61% of Kenyans using their phone for mobile payments. In contrast, only 2% of Africans have a working landline phone, further accentuating the prevalence and importance of mobile there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of which raises the question: If texting to pay is so successful in Africa, who’s to say it won’t see the same success here?</span></p>
<h2><b>Why Companies Need to Offer Text to Pay</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S., mobile is also a part of everyday life, but mobile payments haven’t seen nearly the same amount of success as they have in Kenya. And while the most common ways to</span><a href="http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/mobile-payment-statistics-1276.php"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">make mobile payments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include mobile wallets (which rely on NFC for transactions), mobile browsers and payment applications, all of these payments are predicated on the fact that customers have a reliable internet connection, or a specific chip in their phone. It’s a lot to expect of a customer, especially when internet use (which is needed for mobile payments in the U.S.) isn’t even</span><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/chapter-three-a-week-in-the-life-analysis-of-smartphone-users"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the most popular feature on a smartphone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That honor goes to text messaging.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-2295 aligncenter" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mobile-pay.png" alt="mobile pay in africa" width="294" height="224" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/chapter-three-a-week-in-the-life-analysis-of-smartphone-users">Image credit Pew Research</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now imagine if businesses applied the same excitement that they did for mobile apps to text messaging. </span><b>They could make mobile payments more accessible to a larger percentage of their client base. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not everyone has a smartphone or access to an internet connection, so businesses that don’t offer texting might be shutting potential customers out. For customers that do have a smartphone, they won’t always want to download an app for each specific store or chain they visit, so businesses could make sure they were still reaching all of their customers with text messaging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texting is also a secure way to pay—all businesses would have to do is direct customers to a secured webpage where they can enter their payment details. Customers also don’t have to be in the same location as their purchase to make a mobile payment, and they can still get the details of their purchase with pictures and descriptions of the items they’re interested in.</span></p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s nothing wrong with the way mobile payments are currently being processed in the U.S. NFC, online payments and applications all have a role to play in how we pay. But imagine what we could learn from mobile payments in Africa, if we opened up accessibility to more customers with texting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The payoff would be huge.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s world, customer service is no longer restricted to a simple phone call. A recent report from</span><a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Global-Microsites/CCBenchmarking"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dimension Data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interactions account for 35% of all contact center interactions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, customers are so vested in the idea of emerging channels that contact centers have ranked it their number one priority. As digital use climbs, nearly 75% of contact centers predict an increase in non-voice interactions within two years. Over 40% expect a decrease in voice traffic in that same time period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of this digital dominance can be attributed to smartphones, which have exploded in popularity over the past few years.</span><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/#smartphones"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Pew Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, over 64% of American adults now own a smartphone, up from 35% in 2011. But it’s not just limited to the U.S.—one in five people across the globe own a smartphone.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-7357"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global smartphone users typically spend 2 hours and 30 minutes a day on their phone, trumping</span><a href="http://bgr.com/2014/05/29/smartphone-computer-usage-study-chart/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">tablets, computers and even television</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the most time spent in front of a screen. Smartphones are also dominating the connected device market, and are predicted to surpass</span><a href="http://www.statista.com/chart/777/global-connected-device-shipments/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">1.7 billion units</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in global sales by 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And customers are certainly app happy—there are</span><a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/2014-mobile-landscape-25-statistics-will-drive-future-mobile-marketing-infographic/89507/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">224 million active app users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S, a little over 70% of the population. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">over</span><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/01/mobile-app-usage-increases-in-2014-as-mobile-web-surfing-declines/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">85% of time spent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a smartphone is spent in apps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But let’s break this down a little bit.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Why Your Mobile Strategy Can&#8217;t Rely on Apps Alone</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the 85% of time spent in apps, </span><b><a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/">32% of this is games and 18% is Facebook</a>.</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The rest of the time is broken up between news, productivity, and other apps (see below). And while it’s true that </span><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2011/oct/28/branded-apps"><span style="font-weight: 400;">91% of top brands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have an app, unless you’re a big hitter like Facebook or Amazon, you’re going to have a hard time getting a customer’s attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of this is because </span><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/21/majority-of-digital-media-consumption-now-takes-place-in-mobile-apps/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">42% of all app time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spent on smartphones takes place within an individual’s most-used app, and 75% of time is spent in their top 4 apps. For the average person, those are most likely going to be social networking apps and games. Think about it&#8211;what are the most commonly used apps on your phone?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, apps aren’t exactly a high-earning channel for companies. Gartner predicted that</span><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2615270/mobile-apps/gartner--93-percent-of-all-mobile-apps-will-be-free-by-2016.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">93% of mobile apps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be free by 2016, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and for those apps that do generate revenue</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Apple and Google also take a 30% cut. Granted, most enterprise apps are free for existing customers, but creating these apps can be a time-consuming process that cost an average of </span><a href="http://resources.kinvey.com/docs/State+of+Enterprise+Mobility+Survey+2014+-+Kinvey.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$270,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to develop and deploy Creating apps for different platforms (iOS, Android, even Blackberry) and deploying regular updates can significantly increase costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For companies that do develop an app, there’s no guarantee that customers will use them. Four out of five customers spend most of their time in</span><a href="http://marketingland.com/report-mobile-users-spend-80-percent-time-just-five-apps-116858"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">their top five apps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, meaning a service app may be overlooked altogether. Customers may have 30-40 apps installed on their phone, but Google research found customers only use</span><a href="https://think.withgoogle.com/mobileplanet/en/downloads/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">about 12 of those apps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within a 30-day period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And apps aren’t always guaranteed to work—according to Pew Research,</span><a href="https://info.dynatrace.com/rs/compuware/images/Mobile_App_Survey_Report.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">over 50% of consumers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have experienced a problem with a mobile app. But, perhaps the most worrisome fact for businesses is that</span><a href="https://info.dynatrace.com/rs/compuware/images/Mobile_App_Survey_Report.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">79% of consumers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will only retry an app once or twice before abandoning it. Despite the fact that every day over 50 million mobile apps are downloaded, </span><a href="http://www.nuance.com/ucmprod/groups/enterprise/@web-enus/documents/collateral/nc_020218.pdf"><b>95% are abandoned</b></a><b> within a month</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is that you don&#8217;t have to rely on an app to provide great customer service or self-service. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Why Texting Needs to Be Part of Your Mobile Strategy</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent study by </span><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/#smartphones"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pew Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that text messaging is “the most widely-used smartphone feature.” Not only do 97% of American smartphone owners use text messaging, but they use it more frequently than any other channel. On a global scale, 90% of people text at least once a day, sending over</span><a href="http://www.openuniversity.edu/news/news/2014-text-messaging-usage-statistics"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">11 billion texts daily</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With usage like this, why haven’t more businesses picked it up?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To their credit, some businesses have. Over</span><a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Global-Microsites/CCBenchmarking"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">37% of contact centers offer SMS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with 23% planning to add it in the coming year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your company can begin adopting text messaging using these following steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Guide agents on proper use.</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Integrate it with other channels. </b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><b>Decide between long codes and short codes.</b></b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Find a balance between automation and live agents. </b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Identify text support targets.</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Create text support discovery mechanisms.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Identify what success looks like. </b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Recognize customer problems. </b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Have a customer experience plan.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Create a text support rollout plan. </b></li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies that have adopted texting have received an overwhelmingly positive response from customers. Customers shipping packages with UPS or FedEx can opt-in to receive automated texts that track their shipment and medical organizations can send patients reminders about when they should take their medication. Contact centers can send customers personalized texts based on service history and past interactions, increasing customer satisfaction.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apps are a highly-used communication channel, but for most businesses, the upfront cost and predominant use of gaming/social apps don’t justify the investment. That’s why texting is such an essential part of your mobile strategy&#8211;it can do almost anything apps can do. It’s fast, it can be professional but personal, it’s easy to use, it’s in real-time, it picks up where you left off, it connects to the Internet, etc. There are some situations where an app will work better, and that’s okay. But before you move ahead with a mobile app, ask yourself one question:</span></p>
<p><strong><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can I use text for that?</span></i></strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tired of ordering pizza over the phone? Domino’s understands—that’s why they’ve launched <a href="anyware.dominos.com">AnyWare</a>, letting you “order your favorite oven-baked goodness on your favorite devices.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not going to lie—this is a pretty awesome use case (in theory). With AnyWare, you can text, tweet and even use your Smart TV to order pizza and more, and all you have to do is send a pizza emoji.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-7253"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D1SrOjuBSEU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Easy as (pizza) pie, right?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not so much, which kinda sucks because I was really excited by the prospect of being able to text to order a pizza. (No really, I was).</span></p>
<p><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-text-1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1743 size-medium" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-text-1-264x300.png" alt="dominos text 1" width="264" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See, the key to ordering pizza from Domino’s on any of your smart devices lies in creating a Pizza Profile apparently, where you have to input your name, email address, and phone number to get your hands on that slice of cheese. By creating an account, you’re able to Easy Order based off of past purchases and skip entering your personal payment information every time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re all about text messaging and effortless service at OneReach, so this seemed like a great use case to test out. Pizza + texting = success, right?!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excited with the thought of pizza for lunch, and with my stomach growling, I went off to create my Pizza Profile. However, hitting the site should have been my first clue as to what I was about to experience because apparently you have to divulge your deepest, darkest secrets to order a pizza. After logging in to enable text ordering, I was presented with a whole lot of pizza legalese asking for my consent.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1744" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos1-546x331.png" alt="dominos1" width="546" height="331" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I entered my phone number and saved my settings. Next, I had to double opt-in to confirm that I did, in fact, want to order pizza.  </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/dominos-text-2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1741 size-medium" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-text-2-e1440719073409-289x300.png" alt="dominos text 2" width="289" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, I had to set up an Easy Order (oh, how I wish it had been) so the system knew what to query. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-double-optin.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1745 size-large" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-double-optin-546x255.png" alt="dominos double optin" width="546" height="255" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost done? I wish! The pop-up told me I had to place my order </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">online</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before I could use text messaging. Honestly, I kind of got the feeling this was a cash grab to get everyone to order way more pizzas than they need, all for supposed convenience’s sake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was at a loss. I didn’t even know </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">where </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to place my Easy Order. Luckily, my phone came to my rescue when I opted in to receive messages and I could start placing my Easy Order.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/dominos-text-3.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1746 size-medium" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-text-3-e1440719007201-269x300.png" alt="dominos text 3" width="269" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just kidding&#8211;I had to go back online </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">again</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So far, not so easy.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/dominos-text-4.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1747 size-medium" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-text-4-e1440719030547-289x300.png" alt="dominos text 4" width="289" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, I don’t want to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheese it up</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—I just want to order my damn pizza over text message.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-cheese-it-up.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1748" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-cheese-it-up.png" alt="dominos cheese it up" width="457" height="291" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C’mon, this is supposed to be easy! I just want to order my pizza over text message!!</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-chocolate.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1749" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-chocolate-546x291.png" alt="dominos chocolate" width="546" height="291" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, on the payment page, I found what I was looking for.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-easy-order.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1750" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-easy-order.png" alt="dominos easy order" width="318" height="142" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awesome. Easy Order saved. Right? Wrong. Even though I submitted my order (14” with pepperoni and mushrooms), I still had no Easy Order to show for it. At this point, I was getting really frustrated (and hungry).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to be deterred, I tried once again to order over text, but because I didn’t save my credit card information, I couldn’t order. Because guess what—the only way to update your payment method is to MAKE ANOTHER PAYMENT.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-credit-card-2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1751" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-credit-card-2-546x73.png" alt="dominos credit card 2" width="546" height="73" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seriously. Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still aiming for my end goal of ordering pizza over text message, I went back <em>online</em> to order something cheap (3 20 oz. sodas) to re-enter my payment information. And when I went back to my phone and texted my little pizza emoji, guess what? Still didn’t work, because life sucks sometimes.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/dominos-text-5.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1752 size-medium" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-text-5-e1440718690657-289x300.png" alt="dominos text 5" width="289" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, the delivery guy was nice enough to deliver my two orders together, and when I asked if my online credit card payment went through (because according to the texts, it wasn’t valid), he showed me the receipt, where it clearly did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, not only was I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> able to order over text message, but I had a heck of a time even trying to order online.</span></p>
<p>The goal of this article is not to bash Domino’s&#8211;they should be applauded for even attempting to deploy a text-to-order service. In addition, I’m assuming that once I got my Easy Order set up, it would have been as easy to order as advertised instead of what I went through.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1753" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1753" style="width: 546px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-happy.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-1753" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-happy-546x287.png" alt="This is definitely not how I felt after trying to order. Photo from Domino&quot;sss" width="546" height="287" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1753" class="wp-caption-text">This is definitely NOT how I felt after trying to order. Photo from Domino&#8217;s AnyWare video.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, what’s ultimately lacking from the Domino’s AnyWare experience is the “anywhere” aspect of it. Domino’s tried and failed to create a seamless omnichannel experience that lets you order pizza whenever, wherever, and however you want. It relied too heavily on the Web to enable an experience that should have taken place largely on other channels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A true omnichannel experience would have seamlessly transferred customers from channel to channel (ie a link to a secure payment page for ordering), rather than forcing them back to the Web to do the very thing they should have been able to do by texting or tweeting: order pizza.</span></p>
<h1><b>Text Domino’s 2.0</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though I didn’t get my pizza over text message, I still wanted to see if there was a better way to design this whole text debacle. Because even though it didn’t work, it should have worked. And it can work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how it should have been done (and can be done). Domino’s, feel free to use this model PUH-LEESE!</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, I would text into Domino’s, without needing a Pizza Profile. That was the one part of the user experience that continuously failed me, </span><a href="http://www.eater.com/2015/5/20/8631373/i-ordered-dominos-pizza-emoji-it-took-three-hours-twitter"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and I’m not</span></a> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/20/dominos-tweet-to-order-system-isnt-as-great-as-it-sounds/#.v3rtkt:wfb2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the only one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Had I not been so committed to seeing this through, I would have bailed with many profanities following and ordered from Papa John’s.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would receive a text message asking if I’d like to place my usual order (not Easy Order, because that sure as heck wasn’t easy), or if I’d like to place a new one.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system would already know my address and billing information, so I wouldn’t have to input that information online, taking me out of my mobile experience. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d confirm that I’d like the pizza delivered to my regular address.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system would then ask me if I’d like to pay with the card I already have on file.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d confirm, and then I’d get a message that my pizza was on my way.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy as that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, why tell you when I can show you? Here’s how it would look&#8230;</span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-2388 aligncenter" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-texting2.png" alt="text dominos" width="301" height="573" /></p>
<p>Want to try a great text-to-order experience for yourself? <strong>Text “PIZZA” to 70700.</strong> Note&#8211;you won’t actually be ordering pizza, and there are no integrations to find the nearest Domino’s or to pay for pizza. Still, it’s an example of what a smart ordering experience could be (and should have been) like.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy!</span></p>
