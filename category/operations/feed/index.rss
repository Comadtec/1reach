								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rise of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwincunningham/2016/03/22/why-messaging-is-the-business-interface-of-the-future/#7f41a5ed6d3e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">messaging for business communication</a> has taken the world by storm, and your contact center needs to be ready to respond. But first, you need to make sure you’re responding on the right channels.</p>
<p>Research done by Harris Poll and commissioned by OneReach found that <a href="http://onereach.com/resources/high-demand-for-text-message-2014-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 60% of customers</a> would rather text than call your business for support. With texting, customers can get a faster, more efficient response to their questions. This value can be seen within customer communications, as well as internal workforce communications.</p>
<h2><span id="more-7411"></span><strong>Contact Centers</strong></h2>
<p>In our experience, texting has been shown to reduce call volume by 40% and decrease phone costs from $6-20 per call to $2-5 per interaction per text chat. By offering the option to pivot to text messaging within your call center’s IVR, your company can deflect calls to a less costly channel, reduce wait times and improve self-service options. In fact, over 40% of customers would prefer to text with an agent than wait on hold.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways texting can have a positive impact on your organization and make it more efficient. Organizations can use messaging to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Respond more with fewer agents.</strong> With text chat, agents can respond to multiple chats at once, lowering the number of agents needed to respond to customer inquiries. Bringing less agents in can help reduce costs but also improve quality of service, since managers can devote more attention to each individual agent. Contact centers can also use texting to send out alerts to customers on system updates or outages to help mitigate inbound call volume.</li>
<li><strong>Review transcripts.</strong> Text conversations, much like web chat, have an easily accessible transcript that can be reviewed and learned from through data mining and analysis of textual conversations. This is better than voice, where you cannot easily monitor quality or track recurring patterns. Contact center managers as well as agents can take a look at the conversations to see if agents were brand compliant, how long the conversation took, what and more. They can also review agent performance across channels and per agent. A solution that uses text analytics can help agents more easily track what customers are texting in about and track “hot terms” to help identify support issues.</li>
<li><strong>Guide the conversation.</strong> Most contact centers use scripts to help agents control the flow of the conversation and stay brand compliant. Your call center can take this to the next level with canned responses. Canned responses are answered recorded ahead of time that can help agents respond more quickly and make sure that answers provide the appropriate information. Canned responses can also be used to help train agents on how they should answer. Your contact center can also use artificial intelligence to autoselect an appropriate response based on a customer query.</li>
<li><strong>Send out automated surveys.</strong> In our experience, text surveys have been shown to get a 20% response rate, higher than the <a href="http://support2.constantcontact.com/articles/FAQ/2344" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15%</a> average of email surveys and <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/traditional/telephone-survey-response-rates-dropping-accuracy-remains-high-22107/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9% response rate</a> of phone surveys. With texting, you can set up automation to send an outbound survey as soon as they finish their conversation and have them rate their interaction on the same channel they responded on. It is natural to answer a survey after the text chat sessions because it is in the same thread. This helps ensure more accurate responses, as texters will better recall the content of a conversation closer to when the interaction happens. Your call center can then review these responses and adjust how customer service is delivered.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Corporate Communication Using Text Messaging</strong></h2>
<p>While the value of the text channel for consumers is starting to be realized by the enterprise, most organizations still do not understand the opportunity for improvement that text messaging can have on their internal workforce communications. Text messaging is a great technology to drive desired employee behavior and improve internal communications between distributed teams.</p>
<p>One great example is to use text messaging to improve communication within a field services organization. Text messages can be sent to field personnel to provide appointment reminders and ensure improved show rates on booked appointments. Text reminders can also include appointment details and ensure a field service person has what they need when they show up on the job.  From the customer perspective they can receive a reminder of the appointment and include a picture of the field service representative, creating a sense of trust and familiarity before the field personnel even arrives.</p>
<p>Companies can also use SMS internally for tasks such as reminding project team members to enter project hours or provide project status updates. The value of this channel is that the message can link directly to a mobile app or mobile web site and help improve employee adherence to internal processes using a channel they appreciate.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>The ultimate value of using text messaging within an organization does not stop at the customer. Using text messaging for corporate communication helps drive more efficient communication within the organization and improves task efficiency in the workforce. By interacting with customers and employees on a channel that’s proven to improve collaboration, reduce costs and get results, companies can ensure that they’re getting the most out of their communication technologies.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Empowerment. That is the word that comes to mind when one considers how recent technological changes have affected a business’ ability to create compelling communication experiences. Despite the fact that the basic tools for making a phone call haven’t changed much in the last 150 years (even your smartphone still offers you a standard numeric keypad, not so different from the rotary phones of old), we are entering an age of innovation around communications such that the world has never seen before. And best of all, many of these technologies don’t require heavy-lifting from IT teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the monolithic incumbents in the enterprise communication space that require multi-million dollar upfront investments and multi-year deployment schedules, the future of communication lies in software. Developers are now able to leverage communication APIs to build proofs of concept in hours or days that they can share with their business partners. Similarly, business analysts can leverage drag-and-drop user interfaces to build communication solutions in minutes, without having to request development resources. Never before have both technical people and non-technical people had so much ability to create meaningful solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are real risks and process challenges to account for when trying to build your own communication solution. There are both technological and experiential conditions that you must account for.</span></p>
<h2><span id="more-7386"></span><b>Getting company-wide buy-in</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting company-wide buy-in is crucial for any project’s success, and it is not always easy to ascertain. One of the leading causes of project failure is lack of collaboration; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 85% of employees and executives cite lack of</span><a href="http://work.com/blog/2012/08/is-poor-collaboration-killing-your-company-infographic/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">collaboration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as leading to a project’s failure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Furthermore, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">75% of business and</span><a href="http://www.geneca.com/75-business-executives-anticipate-software-projects-fail/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">IT executives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> think their IT projects are doomed from the start, and project managers say executives ultimately determine what the fate of the project will be</span><a href="http://reports.informationweek.com/abstract/83/12175/IT-Business-Strategy/research-2014-enterprise-project-management-survey.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 63% of the time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, be it elimination or deferment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By taking a new approach (either building a POC on top of a communication API or a Software-as-a-Service application), the “go/no go” discussions will be far more productive. Think of it this way&#8211;in less time than it would take a business analyst to document requirements and engage with their technical counterparts to scope out level of effort, that same person could build a proof of concept and share a working example of a proposed solution to spark more productive conversations with the stakeholders. This makes it easier to achieve a shared vision and more buy-in.</span></p>
<h2><b>Lack of user experience expertise</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication solutions are usually customer facing, thus amplifying the risk associated with introducing a new experience. Creating an ‘on-brand’ customer experience is no small feat, and requires rapid cycles of design, build, test, repeat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaving experience design in the hands of a developer (or skipping the experience design process altogether) is risky; customers have expectations that you’ll likely want to meet and understand.  If they’re not trained in UX design, your developers may end up creating an experience that isn’t on brand and doesn’t improve the relationship with your customers. Furthermore, custom programming a solution may inhibit the ability to iterate rapidly and improve the experience over time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, building a text-messaging notification solution using a communication API provider is quite simple, but developers often neglect the fact that recipients will reply to those text messages and therefore don’t have any response strategy. In addition, if you develop your own solution, you will also have to build a user experience report in order to know where and how the solution can be improved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, using a SaaS application that has productized many features that protect the ability to iterate rapidly based on real data allows for the experience to be improved over time, and without having to request developer resources every time a change is requested. The pace of improvement is therefore instant.</span></p>
<h2><b>Cost of development and maintenance</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers love to build things, but they don’t enjoy the ongoing care and feeding that enterprise communication solutions require. And the ugly truth is that developing a custom solution, rather than configuring it through an existing software application, requires much more investment than you might think. Developing against third-party communication APIs removes nearly all of the complexity surrounding the complicated telephony network, but the normal software costs are still required, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Application monitoring</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infrastructure monitoring</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Load balancing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Database management</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quality assurance testing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infrastructure maintenance</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Benefits of using SaaS applications</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As outlined above, developing your own cloud communication solution can come with some big risks. However, creating it through a SaaS platform offers several key benefits:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b><b>Time to market. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you have a very clear vision for the ideal solution, it can take time to get your solution to where you want it to be and constant change requests burden the development team. With a hosted cloud communication solution, you can get any changes or updates deployed in no time.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Built-in features. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most cloud communication platforms will come with built-in features to eliminate the complexity of custom development. By productizing certain features, including integrations, users can leverage best practices and benefit from features that would otherwise be left in the ‘nice to have’ column and never be developed.. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Flexibility. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hosted cloud solutions come with a lot of flexibility, from custom design for communication flows to integrations to even custom skins that reflect your brand.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Built-in support team. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If something were to go wrong with your own solution, you’d have to devote your own resources to troubleshoot and fix it. With a hosted cloud communication solution, you have a dedicated support team on hand that will diagnose and correct any issues without you having to do a thing.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Business continuity. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of having to custom develop integrations with CRMs or other systems you might use, a hosted cloud solution will usually come with built-in integrations with the most popular CRMs. This way, you can ensure the right data is being passed between your cloud system and CRM. And if you’re using proprietary systems, it is easier to configure a custom integration than it is to develop one.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing your own cloud communication solution comes with inherent risks and pitfalls. By investing in an existing cloud platform, you’ll save money in the process and be able to provide your customers with a professional, well-designed customer experience.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a lot of call center metrics out there that measure customer satisfaction—CSAT, Net Promoter Score (NPS), even First Call Resolution (FCR). The way they measure satisfaction is different, but the end result is the same—to make sure the customer is happy.</p>
<p>But what if I told you there was a call center metric that could do nothing but measure a customer’s happiness, one that tracked their satisfaction through every interaction?</p>
<p>There is, and it’s called the Smiley Face Index (SFI).</p>
<h1><span id="more-7264"></span><strong>What is the Smiley Face Index?</strong></h1>
<p>The Smiley Face Index isn’t meant to displace other more complex call center metrics.  Rather, it’s just the simpler way of looking at customer satisfaction that we sometimes need. It literally measures the number of smiley faces exchanged by a customer and agent during a web-chat or text message interaction. Simply put, more smiley faces = more happy customers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.icmi.com/~/media/Images/Resources/Articles/2015/09/SmileyIndex.ashx" alt="call center metrics smile" width="461" height="165" /></p>
<p>Smiley faces are symbols that have meaning—they show how happy or excited we are. And while The Smiley Face Index might not be as all-encompassing or sophisticated as other metrics, it is a great way to get a feel for current customer sentiment, and also assess agent performance in real time.</p>
<p>For example, if Agent A is has 10 interactions with customers and none of the customers send smiley faces, that could mean one of two things: either they didn’t feel like sending a smiley face, or the service provided didn’t warrant a smiley face.</p>
<p>However, if Agent B has 10 interactions with customers and 7 out of 10 send smiley faces, then, as a contact center manager, you can tell that that agent is doing something right. That’s not to say that Agent A isn’t doing a good job—it just means that Agent B is doing something that warrants smiles from customers.</p>
<p>And you can bet that even if a customer is prompted to give a smiley face, they’re certainly not going to unless it’s merited. However, it’s good to remember that <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118562/emoticons-effect-way-we-communicate-linguists-study-effects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">women are twice as likely to use emoticons as men</a>, as found in a study from Rice University.</p>
<p>We’ve even seen some companies close out their support tickets/sessions by simply asking “Have I made you <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> or <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ? Is there anything else I can help you with?”</p>
<p>Ultimately, if no agents are getting smiley faces, it could be an indicator that the current level of service is worth putting some thought into.</p>
<h1><strong>What makes SFI different from other call center metrics</strong></h1>
<p>While the Smiley Face Index can be subjective, it is a quick, practical tool that you can use right away to get a quick “thermometer-read” at any given time &#8211; real time&#8230;like the heartbeat monitor of happiness.</p>
<p>You see, the point of the Smiley Face Index isn’t to get the most smiley faces—it’s to provide such great service that you make your customer smile. A lot of other metrics and measurements around customer satisfaction don’t address that—they deal strictly with numbers and scores, with definitions and averages.</p>
<p>The genius of the Smiley Face Index is that it eschews all the <strong>common call center metrics</strong> (which are all very important, don’t get me wrong) to focus on the importance of pleasing customers and making it a daily focus. It literally tracks whether or not the experience you’re providing can garner a  smile. If you review a digital interaction ending in a smiley face, you can see what was so good about it and build off of that. Was it resolved on the first try? Was it handled in under X minutes? You can learn from that experience to build better ones.</p>
<h1><strong>Service with a smile</strong></h1>
<p>One of our clients, a staffing agency, decided to offer customers the ability to text after using a clunky IVR for several years. They let customers channel pivot from voice to SMS and were able to deflect over 40% of calls to SMS.</p>
<p><a href="https://helix.northwestern.edu/article/kindness-contagious-new-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kindness has been shown to be contagious</a>, so if one person is happy and shares that (ie a customer), it will make the agent happy as well. Positive feedback is shown to be “<a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ayelet.fishbach/research/FEF%20Compass%202010.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more effective in goal pursuit</a>”, which we could build on to mean that tracking SFI could help agents do their job better. In fact, studies have found that positive people are also better at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2580208/Does-happiness-make-SMARTER-Positive-people-better-solving-problems-unhappy-counterparts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">solving problems</a>.</p>
<p>Another one of our clients, a health and wellness company, deployed SMS support for their VIP users. The users were ecstatic about being able to text for support, saying things like “I love it” or sending a smiley face. In this case, the new users were shown something happy (a new service that was a benefit of their membership) and were excited to start using it (saying, “this is crazy awesome!”). In addition, a smiley face <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> is the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcc4.12063/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most-used emoticon</a>, and a<a href="http://news.psu.edu/story/358366/2015/05/21/research/emoticons-may-signal-better-customer-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gents who use emoticons</a> are more likely to receive higher scores than agents who don’t use emoticons. That could be because “<a href="http://www.herizons.ca/node/554" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the emoticon is arguably a linguistic strengthener</a> that enhances the recipient’s understanding of the tone behind the text.”</p>
<p>Simply put, happiness (and smiles) broaden your mind.</p>
<p>There are plenty of examples of customer experiences that have made customers smile—what makes customers happy will ultimately vary by industry or channel. However, the Smiley Face Index should, at the very least, be a new way of looking at something, or at the very best, be a force for galvanizing change and prioritizing happiness, for your customers and your agents.</p>
<h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>
<p>Now, The Smiley Face Index isn’t meant to replace traditional call center metrics, nor should it. It’s supposed to be another perspective on achieving what should be each contact center’s ultimate goal—making the customer happy.</p>
<p>So, are you delivering service worth smiling about?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">One of our clients has seven telephony providers&#8211;we are the eighth. Thankfully, we’re helping them consolidate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over the last six weeks, we’ve been able to migrate 60 percent of their traffic to the OneReach platform. Good for us, right? But even better for them.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7184"></span>By consolidating vendors, they’ve been able to save themselves time, money, and a heck of a lot of stress. And guess what? You business can do this too. Check out great benefits of consolidation below:</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Centralized management on any scale</h1>
<p dir="ltr">In a centralized company, the most important decisions are made by higher-ups or headquarters instead of branch managers&#8211;decisions are made in one central location and passed downwards. Not only does this save branch managers time, it also ensures that the customer experience is <a href="http://yourbusiness.azcentral.com/advantage-disadvantage-centralizing-management-control-6635.html">consistent</a> and <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc539020.aspx">efficient</a> anywhere in the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">By letting headquarters make the important decisions, everyone reaps the benefits: headquarters can use their knowledge and experience to the company’s advantage, giving branch managers the time to focus on staff, who can then focus on customers. It’s a win-win-win-win scenario.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Centralized data and analytics</h1>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.techradar.com/us/news/world-of-tech/the-importance-of-big-data-analytics-in-business-1267606">According to Gartner analyst Svetlana Sicular</a>, &#8220;Big data is a way to preserve context that is missing in the refined structured data stores.” This might sound complicated, but what she’s basically that data is stronger united than it is divided.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, a lot of companies have their data divided. Each department or branch collects different types of data based on what’s important to them (i.e. channel preferences, purchase history, etc). and stores it in different locations. It’s difficult for businesses to make informed decisions when they aren’t looking at the whole picture.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, centralized data and analytics aim to change all that. <a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=584">Storing data in one central location</a> means employees can retrieve branch-specific or company-wide data in exactly the same place. This provides a better idea of what’s going on company-wide, but also helps them relate data points that had previously been separated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Centralizing data works equally well for customer insight: instead of reaching out to marketing about a customer’s communication preferences, sales can find that information in exactly the same place marketing does.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Increased context</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Centralization and consolidation can be just as great for your customers as it is for your company. After all, customers shouldn’t have to jump from department to department or channel to channel to get the answers they need. The same information should be available regardless of who they contact or how they contact them.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=540">One way to do this is with screen pops</a>—notifications that provide agents with relevant customer information. Instead of going into a customer call blind, agents can then personalize their conversations based on the customer’s past interactions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Automated solutions like IVR can do this too. Instead of presenting each customer with the same generic prompt, your IVR can review Customer A’s past interactions, see that their car is due for a tune-up, then provide them with an immediate option to do so.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Reducing the number of vendors you have isn’t an easy decision to make, and it shouldn’t be. It’s a big leap for any company, but if you do it right, it can be a positive one, too.</p>
