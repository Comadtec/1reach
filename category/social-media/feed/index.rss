								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you stop and think about it, Twitter and text messaging aren’t so different. They both have limited characters (140 and 160), they’re both fast-moving channels, and they’re both widely-used channels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how widely-used? Let’s take a look.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-7354"></span><img class="size-full wp-image-2237 aligncenter" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/compare2.png" alt="twitter vs sms" width="600" height="258" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right—texting is used 46 times </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than Twitter on any given day. But that’s not the only way Twitter and texting are different. There are</span><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/04/28/47-percent-of-brands-dont-use-twitteror-do-they/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">63 million active Twitter users in the U.S.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, compared to</span><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">309 million text messaging users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In addition,</span><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">74% of smartphone users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> check social media every day, </span><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/#smartphones"><span style="font-weight: 400;">compared to 97% of texters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why is it that more brands are on Twitter than use text messaging?</span></i></p>
<p><a href="http://marketingland.com/study-92-percent-of-top-brands-tweet-avg-12x-per-day-audiences-grew-20-percent-in-q4-71199"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 98% of top brands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are on Twitter, but almost no one knows companies are using SMS. You have to navigate to the contact us page, look for the phone number, and even then it might not be text-enabled. </span><a href="https://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you look at the contact center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, text and social are a little more evenly matched (43% social to 37% text messaging), but social still takes the lead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While businesses may be focused on rolling out social channels, customers are more interested in using text messaging. Research has found that while</span><a href="http://www.parature.com/social-love-it-leave-it/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">37% of online adults</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have used social for customer service, research has found that</span><a href="http://www.eweek.com/networking/consumers-like-using-text-messages-to-solve-customer-service-issues.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">75% of customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">prefer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to use texting over social media. And brands that use text messaging successfully have been able to reach</span><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylsnappconner/2013/11/12/fifty-essential-mobile-marketing-facts/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">95% of smartphone and non-smartphone users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while top brands that use social media only reach</span><a href="https://www.forrester.com/Social+Relationship+Strategies+That+Work/fulltext/-/E-RES113002"> <b>2% of their followers</b></a><b>.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But why are social brands only able to reach such a small percentage of their followers when texting can reach so many? Part of it might be because social messages are public, not private.</span></p>
<h2><b>Twitter vs SMS: The Key Differences</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing that really differentiates texting from Twitter is that it’s truly one to one. There’s no massive social audience—it’s just you and the company. On Twitter, it’s a great, big social world where </span><a href="https://moz.com/blog/when-is-my-tweets-prime-of-life"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the average half life of a tweet is 18 minutes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With so many messages being shared in a social shouting match, it’s no wonder 40% of tweets get no response, according to </span><a href="https://twitter.app.box.com/customer-service-on-twitter"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter’s customer service handbook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Compare that to text messaging, which has a </span><a href="http://mobilemarketingwatch.com/sms-marketing-wallops-email-with-98-open-rate-and-only-1-spam-43866/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">98% open rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a </span><a href="https://www.marketingtechblog.com/text-messaging/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">45% response rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s another key difference that separates Twitter and texting. On Twitter, brands might be more inclined to care than over SMS because situations can escalate out of control in the public eye. When messages are public, there’s a higher chance of misinterpretation and negativity, with some customers resorting to social because they know they’ll get a response. Part of the reason companies are on Twitter is to be part of the conversation, be it positive or negative. If customers could just start spamming customers over text messaging, companies might be more interested in using it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s one final difference where we look at Twitter vs SMS: you can’t successfully automate Twitter because it’s so front-facing and public. In fact,</span><a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/76915#replies-mentions"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter itself frowns on automated responses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (emphasis added):</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reply and mention functions are intended to make communication between users easier, and automating these processes in order to reach many users is considered an abuse of the feature…</span><b>media or brands using auto-response campaigns must request approval from Twitter and may be subject to additional rules. </b></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands using automated responses have also raised eyebrows,</span><a href="http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/brands-auto-replies-twitter/496033"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">much to the chagrin of customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-2263 aligncenter" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bofa_occupy_auto_tweet.jpg" alt="twitter vs sms" width="565" height="360" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the cost savings that come with automation, automating Twitter responses is a bad practice for brands. But while some brands can get away with it, they still often require customers to pass along their personal information or switch to another channel, like voice, to get the help they need. Not a very good customer experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about it this way: how would callers feel if you asked them to tweet you instead of connecting with an agent? That would be a very disjointed customer experience that didn’t even get you the help you needed. And can you get people from your IVR to web-chat? NOPE. But guess what &#8211; you can transition callers from your IVR, hold or call queues to SMS-based self-service or live SMS support.</span></p>
<h2><b>Enter the Channel Pivot</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Twitter’s proclamations that companies need to put Twitter first for customer service, voice still reigns supreme as the top service channel. </span><a href="https://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 65% of contact center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> actions are over voice, and virtually all contact centers offer phone support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right here is where texting can fill the gap that Twitter can’t. With </span><a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/channel-pivot-how-switching-from-voice-to-sms-benefits-everyone/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">channel pivot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, customers can seamlessly switch from voice to text without losing track of where they were in the conversation. When customers come calling (and that’s most likely the channel they’ll use), they can have the option to pivot to text to speak with a live agent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Twitter, the only channel you can pivot to is Direct Message. If you want to get things fully resolved, you’ll have to either call in or visit their website for more in-depth information. That’s why channel pivot between voice and text is great for the customer. Channel pivot gives customers the flexibility to engage with a company on their terms. If it’s loud outside, customers can pivot to text to talk with a company. If they’re sharing sensitive information, customers can switch back to voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Channel pivot is also great for companies. Switching a call from voice to text decreases the cost of the session immensely (</span><a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/analystreports/enterprise-application/forrester-tei-atg-359304.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$6-20 per session</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="http://www.providesupport.com/about-us/articles/live-chat-increases-satisfaction.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about $1 per session</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Companies can also look at what points in their IVR are customers switching to text messaging, then offer texting as a first option for customers when they reach that spot in the IVR.</span></p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers spend a lot of time using social media—there’s no arguing that. However, they spend far more time using text messaging. Customers also would prefer to text a company over using social media. That’s not to say that companies should abandon social media, but rather take into consideration offering channels that customers are using.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you had to choose where to spend money, ask yourself where customers are spending their time: on social media or text messaging?</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post originally appeared on <a href="http://www.desk.com/blog/4-ways-to-provide-great-customer-service-on-twitter/">Desk.com</a>.</em></p>
<p>Social media sites are some of the most-used in the world, with<a href="http://www.thesocialmediahat.com/active-users"> Twitter sitting firmly</a> in the top five.<a href="https://about.twitter.com/company"> According to Twitter</a>, there are 288 million active Twitter users, and more than <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCQQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.internetlivestats.com%2Ftwitter-statistics%2F&amp;ei=zfTxVMq7LPPLsASwlYK4BA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGCF_5tD3mFE3geCcxsG2sauaNSWg&amp;bvm=bv.87269000,d.cWc">500 million tweets</a> are sent every day. Is your business using this popular communication channel to support your customers?</p>
<p>Here are 4 ways to offer great customer service on Twitter.</p>
<h2><span id="more-7212"></span>1. Be fast.</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.maritzresearch.com/~/media/Files/MaritzResearch/e24/ExecutiveSummaryTwitterPoll.ashx">Studies have found</a> that 70% of customer service complaints on Twitter are <em>never</em> answered. If and when tweets do get answered, the average response time is<a href="http://simplymeasured.com/blog/2013/06/18/customer-service-whats-working-on-twitter-study/"> 4.6 hours</a>, by which time most customers have had to figure things out themselves. In fact,<a href="http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-research/42-percent-of-consumers-complaining-in-social-media-expect-60-minute-response-time/"> over 40% of customers</a> expect a response within one hour–any longer and you could risk losing a customer for good.</p>
<p>Over one million people view tweets about customer service each week, and about 80% of those tweets<a href="http://www.helpscout.net/75-customer-service-facts-quotes-statistics/"> are negative</a>. If a negative tweet stays out there without response, it can create a negative perception of your company. You can’t delete a negative tweet, but you can respond to it ASAP and show that you care about what customers are saying. Try and answer with as much depth as possible, but at the very least, answer quickly and then follow up.</p>
<p>Depending on your company’s size, it might not be possible to answer a customer tweet immediately. One way to make sure complaints don’t go unanswered is to set up mobile or email notifications instead of having a tab open on your computer and trying to keep up. If you respond to customer complaints in under an hour, you’re meeting their minimum expectations. If you respond within minutes, you’ll be golden. Plus, a quick tweet back can generate more business—<a href="http://soulofbrands.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/nm-incite-report-the-state-of-social-customer-service-2012.pdf">71% of customers</a> are more likely to recommend a brand that provides quick and helpful answers on social media.</p>
<h2>2. Train your customer service team to manage social</h2>
<p>Social may be one of the most popular channels out there, but for some reason,<a href="http://www.tmcnet.com/channels/hosted-contact-center/articles/377920-companies-ignoring-social-media-put-their-survival-the.htm"> 60% of companies</a> don’t formally support social customer care. Of those companies, 68% said one of their biggest challenges was observing and coaching agents. Companies need to face this challenge head on and set aside part of their budget to training service agents on social best practices. They should come away with an understanding of how to answer questions in a way that’s consistent to the brand and stays within the character limits.</p>
<p>On Twitter, service agents should respond with a question to increase responsiveness and encourage conversation. (Agents can make things more personal by adding their initials or name). If a customer isn’t able to solve a problem the first time, follow up with an alternative method. To decrease response time, customer service agents should make a list of common customer questions and answers. If possible, have agents from different time zones monitoring the company Twitter account to make sure customers always get a response. How you respond and how many people are on your social response team will ultimately vary by organization.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to manage customer complaints or tweets is with a dedicated service account like <a href="https://twitter.com/hpsupport">@nikesupport</a> or<a href="https://twitter.com/nikesupport">@HPsupport</a>.<a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/alltwitter/twitter-customer-service_b42180"> A study by Simply Measured</a> found that 99% of brands are on Twitter, and 30% of them have a dedicated customer service handle. This makes sense, since most Twitter accounts are used for marketing and awareness, but not all businesses may be able to manage two accounts. If you do have a second account, odds are most people won’t tweet to this account, so market it on your main Twitter handle to increase awareness. In addition, you should monitor tweets to your main account within your social media dashboard. Even if you don’t have a second account, having a team trained to handle social customer input will go a long way for your business.</p>
<h2>3. Be proactive</h2>
<p>This might sound similar to “be fast,” but it’s not quite the same. Whether or not you have a dedicated service account, you need to make sure your Twitter feed has some customer service substance. You don’t just want it to be a bunch of replies to customers—you want content that helps people. If you see a question pop up several times, consider creating some content or an FAQ page that addresses that question that customers can refer to. Even better, start a conversation on Twitter and ask people what they want to know about your product—that way you’ll have extremely helpful content before a problem even starts.</p>
<p>But let’s say a problem does start. If your site goes down in the Denver metro area or a flight from Orlando is delayed, address the problem before you get a bunch of angry tweets. (Social dashboard tip: if you know service will be down in a particular city, set up a stream to monitor tweets mentioning your company within a certain mile radius). By heading off the problem before things get ugly, you’ll be able to demonstrate you can quickly handle any customer service troubles that come your way. Of course, customers might not always see that tweet, so don’t be afraid to retweet it several times while the problem is getting resolved.</p>
<h2>4. Direct them to another channel</h2>
<p>Twitter is just one weapon in your support arsenal, and it’s not always going to be the best way to deal with customers. Sure, you could always answer your customer’s question in-depth with a series of 10 back-to-back tweets, but that’s not a great customer experience. If things are going to get really technical, really personal (like with credit card information), or really emotional, consider moving the conversation offline or onto another channel. Conversing with an angry customer in a public forum like Twitter only increases the chances of negative tweets being seen.</p>
<p>The best way to do this is to integrate channels so customers don’t have to start their conversation all over again (<a href="http://www.parature.com/2013-customer-expectations/">which they don’t really like</a>). Using a platform that monitors traditional support channels like voice and email, as well as alternative channels like social and text messaging, is the best way to go. This way, agents can maintain the context of the conversation and deliver more personalized support instead of starting things all over again.</p>
<p>At <a href="onereach.com">OneReach</a>, we recommend offering customers the option to text to transfer out of a public space. If they need to exchange personal information or are getting frustrated on social media, text messaging is an ideal option. And since texting and tweeting are so similar (character constraints, mobile devices, etc.), customers have an option that doesn’t require them to make a dramatic channel change. Your support team can ask customers to text a toll-free number and then text their Twitter handle, which customer service agents can refer to in order to respond to specific questions. With <a href="http://www.statista.com/chart/2109/time-spent-on-social-networks-by-platform/">86% of Twitter users</a> on mobile and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCQQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2012%2F12%2F03%2Ftech%2Fmobile%2Fsms-text-message-20%2F&amp;ei=C_XxVI6fCarjsASbtIHQBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFMPaknscanhgE8wCyMlp0l-E4IbA&amp;bvm=bv.87269000,d.cWc">23 billion texts</a> being exchanged each day (compared to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCQQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.internetlivestats.com%2Ftwitter-statistics%2F&amp;ei=zfTxVMq7LPPLsASwlYK4BA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGCF_5tD3mFE3geCcxsG2sauaNSWg&amp;bvm=bv.87269000,d.cWc">500 million tweets</a>), SMS is a great complement to Twitter customer service.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>More often than not, people will tweet about bad service experiences, but social customer service is a chance for your brand to really shine.<a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/cust-exp-impact-report-epss-1560493.pdf"> A recent study</a> found that when a company responded to a customer complaint, nearly half of customers were pleased, and 22% posted a positive comment afterwards. If your company provides great customer service on Twitter, potential customers will take note and think better of your company.</p>
<p>Do that enough times and you’ll be providing customer service that will make people take notice (and in a positive way).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">When a company’s brand is praised on social media, it can be like a dream come true. But when it goes bad, it can go really bad. Who can forget last year’s social media failures of companies like <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/applebees-social-media-faux-pas-learning-experience-f1B8251556">Applebee’s</a> and <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/pace-picante-stirs-up-social-media-fail-kyle-kinane2013-12">Pace salsa</a>?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Yikes.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7171"></span>Customers are online more than ever before. In fact, <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/273018/number-of-internet-users-worldwide/">the number of global internet users</a> has grown to 2.92 billion, up over 200 million users since 2013. Customers are also increasingly using social media sites—primarily on their mobile devices. That means companies need to meet their audience where they already are, rather than forcing them to seek support over an “officially supported” channel. After all, you can’t stop someone from mentioning your brand on social media. All you can do is hope to know about it and influence the conversation in a positive way, and that&#8217;s why you need social media support.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Why Customers Use Social Media</h1>
<h2 dir="ltr">They want to vent</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Sometimes customers have had a bad experience and want to “punish” the offending company with bad publicity. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/22/comcast-earnings_n_5609755.html">To prevent a revolt of Comcast proportions</a>, one solution is to rescue customers by offering to move the conversation to a more intimate venue, like SMS text. But don’t force it&#8211;customers are sensitive to being hushed. In the meantime, make sure that all responses are contrite, respectful, and aimed at solving the problem.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">They want to be heard</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Social media is a distribution platform. People want to use it as a soapbox. Acknowledge that you’ve heard them and give them the option to communicate over a more private channel like email or SMS text.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">They want to engage</h2>
<p dir="ltr">They want real support&#8230;not just a form response from a marketing department. Use SMS to prove that you are willing to engage with them and solve their problem.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Who Owns Social Media?</h1>
<p dir="ltr">The marketing department typically handles social media for the business, while customer support owns other channels. SMS text can act as a great bridge between the two departments. The customer will like that because they are both thumb-based and mobile. A perfect example of this is the ability to text an airline: “My flight has been cancelled. How do I get on the next flight?” The customer appreciates the immediacy of texting during a time-sensitive interval, and the company appreciates the customer’s willingness to engage with them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As stated in a recent <a href="http://www.parature.com/10-gartner360-takeaways/">Gartner</a> report, “By 2015, at least 60% of Internet users will opt for mobile customer service applications as their first option.” With the year drawing a close, it begs the question: is your business ready to engage customers on mobile?</p>
