								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The protection of proliferation of user data were two big themes repeatedly touched up on by Bond Capital’s Mary Meeker at Code Conference 2019 earlier in June.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meeker’s Internet Trends slide deck covered the gamut of trends dominating the industry, pulling back the layers of Internet use at home, abroad, and for personal and business use. </span></p>
<p><strong>Key findings included: </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; For the first time in history, Americans are spending more time on their mobile devices than watching TV. A 2019 estimate reports that adults spent an average of 3 hours and 46 minutes on their phones per day compared to 3 hours and 36 minutes watching TV. By comparison, in 2009, TV reigned with 4 hours and 26 minutes per day while mobile use clocked in at just 20 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; An increasing number of people are using images to communicate: More than 50% of all tweets now include images. Platforms such as Instagram are amplifying this relatively new style of digital communication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; About 25% of people consider themselves always online. Among the 18-to-29 year-old demographic, that number jumps to 39%, according to Pew Research cited in Meeker’s report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; According to Nielsen, most television viewers are multi-platform multitaskers, with 88% of viewers saying they use a second digital device while watching TV, and 71% saying they look up content related to what they’re watching mid-show.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Messaging platforms offering automatic or optional end-to-end encryption are rapidly rising in popularity, with secured services like Telegram and WhatsApp outpacing the growth of non-encrypted messaging services like Twitter and China’s WeChat. At the start of this year, 87% of web traffic was encrypted, compared to just 53% in 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; When used properly, data and AI can improve customer satisfaction. In a survey of retail customers, 91% said they prefer brands that provide personalized offers and recommendations; 83% said they are willing to passively share data for personalized experiences; and 74% said they are willing to actively share data for personalized experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Seven of the ten most valuable companies in the world are now tech firms, led by #1 Microsoft, #2 Amazon, #3 Apple, #4 Alphabet, #6 Facebook, #7 Alibaba, and  #8 Tencent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Americans spent 6.3 hours per day using digital media in 2018, a rise of 6.8% from 2017 and nearly double the time spent (3.2 hours) in 2010.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Cloud deployment represented 22% of all American workflows, double the amount from 2010.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; 59% of everyday transactions in 2018 were done digitally, with 41% done in stores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; In 2018, 51% of humanity had Internet access, up from 24% in 2009.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Cyber-security continued to improve, with the average attack-to-detection dwell time down to 78 days in 2018 from 416 days in 2011.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
