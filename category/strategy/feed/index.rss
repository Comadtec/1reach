								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>“If you think of neural networks as a software stack and not just a pretty good classifier, it becomes quickly apparent that they have a huge number of advantages and a lot of potential for transforming software in general.”</i></b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reinterpreting the way you understand neural networks will completely change the way you think of software. And, according to Andrej Karpathy, the Director of AI at Tesla, it’s for the best. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coined “Software 2.0”, which is written by neural network weights rather than humans, these weights will not replace Software 1.0 (much to the relief of today’s coders). Instead, Software 2.0 will help to lighten the load, taking on tedious tasks involved in creating the software behind visual and speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, robotics, and games. Karpathy’s argument for the numerous benefits of porting complex programs into Software 2.0, despite its recognized limitations, should be enough to convince any coder to accept this new age transition.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>72% of business execs believe AI will be the business advantage of the future.</strong></p>
<p>Technology is great at interrupting the everyday norm, especially when it comes to business. But perhaps no other sector of business is in greater need of reinvention than management, which is tasked with the bulk of a company’s work.</p>
<p>In order to keep up with the demand, management teams are finding creative ways to implement AI, optimizing processes and making better use of their limited time. And, according to a Digital IQ survey done recently, it’s not just some management teams strategizing with AI, it’s more than half.</p>
<p>54% of business executives making “substantial investments” in AI today, and that number is only predicted to continue its rapid growth trend.</p>
<p>Among the AI innovations these execs are most excited to take advantage of are:</p>
<p>The ability to have full-time virtual personal assistants (31%)<br />
Automating data analysis (29%)<br />
Automating email communication and utilizing chatbots (28%)</p>
<p>By freeing up their time by allowing AI to take care of the most repetitive tasks, management executives can focus more on big ideas, helping their companies grow more rapidly and efficiently.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to understand the importance of chatbots and voice bots in today’s business world, you first have to note the context in which they are being created. Despite the illusion of complexity, both types of bots are just software operating on an interface. And that interface also isn’t anything new; it’s actually the first interfaced used by humans: language. Built in to our cognitive development as humans, language is very much a part of who we are. Bots, then, aren’t creating something new. Instead, they’re simply finding a new way to do what we as humans have done for millenniums.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the heart of the chatbot and voice bot revolution is the desire (and capacity) for using language to communicate with computers. The ability to do this means that we can actually train computers to not just understand, but also create, language, giving them the ability to tap into the interface we know so well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order for future bot experiences to be successful, they must be well-versed in the human language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do they acquire these skills?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the training we give to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it would be plausible for the opposite to take place (us training ourselves to talk to computers, aka coding), it’s a much better user experience for computers to learn to speak to us via our language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This, then, brings us to the 10 business, design and technology questions that everyone should explore before setting out to build bots or create other AI solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re already past questions like “how do bots and AI work?”, “what can they do for my organization?” and “should my organization make a bot?”. You already know that stuff, and likely the last thing you need is more marketing and sales pitches peddling bots and AI as the magic answer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re looking to make your existing stuff more awesome or you&#8217;re just getting started on your first AI and bot-stuffs, we think that you’ll be glad for the questions and answers our customers came across through many years of bot-building and AI problem solving.</span></p>

<p><strong>Here are 10 questions that everyone should explore before/during building bots and AI solutions.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><b>How can I future-proof my bot’s design, development and management? <i><span style="font-weight: 200;">Now this may seem like an advanced question, and it is, but in order to save yourself and your organization lots of painful time and money, we’re going to get you thinking about it early. There’s no better way to get thinking about it than to get some important questions stuck in the back of your head &#8211; try your best to keep running through them as you’re working through building great bot experiences. </span></i></b>
<ul>
<li><b>How c</b><b>an I avoid betting early on AI platforms without missing early payouts or stifling progress?</b> <i><span style="font-weight: 200;">Wow &#8211; that’s a doozy. There’s a lot of action in the AI space right now and a lot of money getting poured into it by all sorts of companies that want you to bet on them. If you’re like us, you might feel a bit like it’s too early to bet on investing in one particular platform like a Watson, Google’s API.ai, Luis, etc, etc. Pick one? Seems like a tough bet. So we subscribe to not picking one &#8211; instead AB test them all and see which one is best for each pieces of the puzzle, knowing that they’ll all continue to change.</span></i></li>
<li><b>What do I need to know in order to avoid super-gluing myself to platforms, providers and languages that might not be future-proof? <i><span style="font-weight: 200;">We’ve learned how important this question becomes to all of our customers by seeing how painful it can be to change platforms, providers and languages mid-flight &#8211; maybe your SMS provider gets too expensive or your understandably weary of building a solution on a proprietary language that’s only usable on one platform &#8211; like Twilio or Nexmo, etc. </span></i></b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 200;"><span style="font-weight: 200;">How could reporting hold my bot back from it’s class, and how can I break the shackles early or avoid them altogether?</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 200;"><strong>Do I just want AI, or do I need AI?</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 200;"><strong>What’s the right channel(s) for my bot, and how can I build my bot to be as scalable as possible to other channels?</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 200;"><strong>Is my bot trained to do the right things and report on the right things, in the right ways for the right people? &#8211; What’s the scope and for who?</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 200;"><strong>What should my bot say if it doesn’t understand somebody’s intent and why does that question matter so much?</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 200;"><strong>What am I doing to make sure my bot’s integrations and 3rd party connectivity scalable and interchangeable?</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 200;"><strong>What’s appropriate for bots and what’s not, and where does my bot fall on the line? </strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 200;"><strong>What do I need to consider when designing hand-offs from my bot to a human?</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 200;"><strong>How can I be sure I’m incorporating graceful failure into the experience my bot offers?</strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 200;"><strong>What can I do to ensure my bot is developed in ways that don’t eternally hand-cuff me to it’s management, iterations and reporting?</strong></li>
</ol>
