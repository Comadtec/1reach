<p><em>This guest post is written by Matthew Olszewski, a Polish writer who covers topics surrounding personal development, psychology and business. </em></p>
<p><span id="more-2204"></span>If you want to stand out from your competition, it isn’t enough to have a high quality product. Many companies have realized the fact that the market isn’t as important as the customers. In addition, the present market is maturing, and acquiring new customers is getting harder. Therefore, it is more profitable to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones. According to experts, maintaining a loyal customer costs a company much less than acquire a new one. These costs are mainly related to marketing, selling and adapting to meet new customer needs. Losing customers means losing not only losing their profits from one transaction, but all purchases which he could make in the future.</p>
<p>Gaining customer loyalty is something very precious. Satisfied customers that are associated with the company for many years, should be the ultimate goal of any company’s activities. This approach is increasingly characterized by forward-thinking companies. Even small entrepreneurs see an opportunity for additional earnings the more they care about their customers.</p>
<p>Each employee should be able to create and satisfy customer needs. However, not every employee is fit to work with customers. The person who is responsible for the company’s relationships with customers, should have the appropriate knowledge, skills and a high work ethic. The following infographic made by <a href="http://www.mattsfactor.com/skills/customer-service-skills/">mattsfactor.com</a> represents the most basic customer service skills. This is obviously a small part of knowledge that as an entrepreneur you should know. I hope that the tips on presented infographic are so practical that you will be able to use them immediately.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This guest post is written by Robbie Richards, a member of the content marketing team at Jitbit.</em></p>
<p>Consider this:</p>
<p>89% of consumers have stopped doing business with a company because of a bad experience.</p>
<p>AND&#8230;</p>
<p>86% will not purchase from a business with negative online reviews.</p>
<p><i>The takeaway?</i></p>
<p>Bad customer service is the fastest way to lose existing customers, and deter potential customers from ever stepping foot in your door.<br />
<span id="more-7409"></span><br />
It is estimated to cost US businesses $84 billion a year.</p>
<p>Despite the bottom line implications, there are still a lot of companies out there failing to make support a major priority in 2016. More attention is given to acquisition, instead of retention.</p>
<p>As a result, companies incur higher marketing costs, their customers jump ship and go to the competition, and profit margins start to shrink.</p>
<p>It will slowly kill a business.</p>
<p>To illustrate just how big of an impact bad customer service can have on <b>your </b>business, the team at <a href="https://www.jitbit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JitBit </a>have put together the infographic below. If you want to learn more, check out the <a href="https://www.jitbit.com/news/bad-customer-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11 most costly traits of bad customer service</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Companies are connecting with customers in more ways than ever, but when it comes to customer support, many businesses still rely on just phone or email. While these are important channels, customers are beginning to expect more options from the companies they do business with. Customers ultimately expect businesses to support how they want to communicate — phone, email, web chat, social media and texting—and they want to work with the companies that make interacting easy.</p>
<p><span id="more-7223"></span>Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not always the case:</p>
<ul>
<li>87% of customers think brands need to work harder to create a seamless experience.</li>
<li>61% of customers were unable to easily switch from one channel to another when interacting with customer service</li>
<li>42% of customer experience professionals say their agents must use multiple applications to manage inquiries across channels</li>
</ul>
<p>Today&#8217;s customers demand an omnichannel experience, one where they can use any channel and receive personalized, seamless service. This type of strategy brings various channels together in a more integrated and consistent way, drawing on past interactions and customer data to create a seamless experience. If customers do have to switch between channels, this kind of approach maintains the conversation no matter what channel they use or where they leave off. A customer can start on a web chat and transition to text conversation without losing the context of that interaction.</p>
<p>But what is an omnichannel customer experience <em>really</em> like? Check out what a day in the life of an omnichannel customer might look like, <strong>and don&#8217;t forget to <a href="http://onereach.com/resources/omnichannel-seamless-experience">download our new ebook</a> on the seamless customer experience.</strong></p>
