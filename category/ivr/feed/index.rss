								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you ready to say bonjour to the simple life? Stella Artois thinks so.</p>
<p><a href="onereach.com">OneReach</a> recently collaborated with <a href="http://www.stellaartois.com/en_us/stella-artois-cidre/hamptons-picnic-properties.html">Stella Artois</a>, ad agency <a href="http://www.mothernewyork.com/">Mother New York</a> and production company <a href="http://www.stopp.se/">Stopp</a> to create a unique user experience for Stella Artois web visitors. To promote their Hamptons Picnic Properties sweepstakes, Stella Artois provided users with an interactive experience where users could chat with brand ambassador Le Président before entering to win the competition.</p>
<p><span id="more-7242"></span>Users who visit the Stella Artois Cidre website can input their phone number and receive a call from the fictional Le Président. The user and Le Président can then engage in a conversation about hair care, the perfect date, and even selfies.</p>
<p>Mother New York was responsible for the overall creative idea and campaign, while Stopp was responsible for the creative execution and development. OneReach facilitated the phone call and voice recognition through VoIP.</p>
<p>Nicole Ferraris, interactive producer at Stopp, had this to say about the OneReach platform:</p>
<blockquote><p>What caught our attention with OneReach was the turnkey solution for voice recognition and the graphical user interface, allowing us to design an interactive phone call very quickly. By leveraging an existing tool set like OneReach, we could devote more of our time to polishing the user experience instead of constructing the underlying system.</p></blockquote>
<p>OneReach CEO Rich Weborg was equally impressed with this unique use case, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>We were really impressed by how the team at Stopp used IVR capabilities to create an engaging (and funny!) interactive video for their marketing program. Our product has a wide variety of use cases, but this was truly a first for us. Stopp’s creative use of our technology was really impressive. They did a great job of weaving the technology (voice and web) together for a seamless experience. We would love to work with them again on equally exciting programs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Want to try out the experience for yourself? Give Le Président a call below! And to learn more about creating a personalized experience for customers, <a href="http://onereach.com/resources/omnichannel-seamless-experience">download our ebook here</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">What’s scarier for businesses than a one-eyed zombie clown lumbering at you with a chainsaw?</p>
<p dir="ltr">The thought of losing $41 billion a year.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7170"></span>That&#8217;s right: poor customer service costs U.S. businesses over <a href="http://www.callcentrehelper.com/the-true-cost-of-poor-customer-service-53029.htm">$40 billion dollars each year</a>. Top frustrations include unhelpful staff, being put on hold, being passed around to multiple agents and the agents’ lack of knowledge. In fact, over 50% of people are so frustrated at the thought of calling a business that they will switch to a competitor without trying to solve the problem.</p>
<p>To get into the Halloween spirit, we thought we’d share the most hauntingly horrific customer service horror stories we’ve had on the phone. Read on&#8230;if you dare!</p>
<h2>The Case of the Disappearing Furniture</h2>
<p dir="ltr">I bought a sectional from a home furniture store that was to be delivered to a new townhouse the week I was moving in. The sales person assured me it would be there on a specific day between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. It didn&#8217;t show up on that day so I called the store where I purchased it. The sales person wasn&#8217;t in so they gave me the number of their customer support. They were unable to to locate it. I was told it shipped from California, but that was all they knew and they would get in touch when it arrived in Denver.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, my living room is now composed of camp chairs of various colors and sizes. Three days go by and I call them only to be told, &#8220;Oh yeah, it&#8217;s in Denver at a warehouse, but we don&#8217;t know where or when they can deliver it.” I ask for the number of the warehouse and am told they are not allowed to give it out.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finally, I ask for a manager and am told they are in a meeting. I am promised that it will be on a delivery truck in the morning. They next day nothing arrives and I call back. Same story from them. I threaten to just return it and go somewhere else and miraculously they locate it and deliver it the next day. The delivery men scratch the floor and are unapologetic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I wrote an email to the company explaining the experience. Still haven&#8217;t heard back. &#8211;Grant</p>
<h2>Disembodied Voices</h2>
<p>I haven&#8217;t called them personally, but I&#8217;ve heard of a consumer goods company with hold times between 4-7 hours long. Seriously. People really want to buy their product. During the hold, they play a series of voice recordings. This sucks since you can’t just put it on speaker and hope to notice when a real voice comes on. &#8211;Kevin</p>
<h2>The Haunted Email Account</h2>
<p>I called into my email provider&#8217;s customer service when I noticed my emails were in British time and my news page was all British news. I was worried that someone had maybe tried to hack into my account. The first guy I reached helped me try and change my computer settings; when that didn&#8217;t work, he transferred me to someone else. After suggesting the same solution the first guy had, he told me he could externally reboot my email account and then monitor my computer remotely for any changes if I paid $129. I denied wanting this service several times after he kept pitching it, and eventually got so frustrated that I hung up. I asked one of my coworkers for help and he got since he had experienced the problem too, he helped me figure it out in under a minute. &#8211;Gigi</p>
<h2>The IVR Road to Nowhere</h2>
<p>I have called into a pharmacy and been placed on hold, told I was the next customer in line, then given a repetitive voice message telling me how much I was valued. After 10 minutes, the system drops the call. This went on 4 times before someone finally picked up. I explained my frustration with experience and was told that they implemented a new phone system that was acting weird (not the case). This still happens months later. No sympathy from the people on the other end just excuses. &#8211;Grant</p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Interactive voice response (also known as IVR) is one of the most notorious service channels of all time. Originally introduced to decrease the amount of time agents needed to spend on the phone while increasing the number of problems solved. Unfortunately, IVR ended up creating brand new problems for the customer: long hold times, confusing menus and the continual inability to reach a rep. Today,<a href="http://www.interactions.net/2011/06/so-people-hate-ivr-is-this-news-to-anyone/"> only 13% of consumers</a> think IVR is easy to use, and only 15% believe IVR use benefits them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Luckily, IVR doesn’t have to be this way.<a href="http://www.nuance.com/for-business/by-solution/customer-service-solutions/newsletter-issue-2/index.htm"> Over two-thirds of consumers</a> would prefer to use self-service technologies like IVR rather than speak with a live agent; they just haven’t had a great experience with it until now. Here are nine IVR best practices on to help you create a better service experience for both companies and customers.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7167"></span><strong>1. Let customers communicate how they want.</strong> Customers don’t think in terms of channels; they’re just trying to solve their problem by any means available. Don’t be afraid to give the caller the option to “speak with someone at any time by pressing star.” If you have the ability to channel pivot, you can provide them the option to switch to text message automation instead of voice automation so they can use the channel they want. It’s not just giving them the option to change the channel; it’s making each existing channel better for the customer.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>2. Keep it short and simple.</strong> Remember that people have no ability to visually see the options: they have to listen to the options one by one, so do everything you can to not include more than four options at a time. The longer the prompt, the more you risk losing their attention and forgetting what they heard in the beginning. Find every opportunity to be extremely concise. For example, “If you are interested in talking with someone about our sales offerings, press&#8230;” can become “For sales, press&#8230;”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>3. Maintain context.</strong><a href="http://www.accenture.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/Accenture-Global-Consumer-Pulse-Research-Study-2013-Key-Findings.pdf"> Almost 90% of customers</a> hate having to repeat their problems multiple times. Keep track of the information gathered in the IVR so that when the customer is finally connected with an agent, they can get right down to business instead of going over the minutiae. The process goes a whole lot faster and the customer doesn’t get flustered trying to get you to <a href="http://pro.whitepages.com/3-tips-providing-ultimate-customer-experience-contact-center/">pronounce their hometown correctly</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>4. Option before action.</strong> Have you ever been in an IVR where you are distracted, hear the option you want and snap back, only to find that the IVR has moved onto the next option? You then have to sit through the entire menu again. Each prompt has an option and an action&#8211;the best practice is to give the option first and the action second. For example, if you want a customer to press one to contact sales, you would say “For Sales” (the option) before “Press One” (the action). That way you don’t risk them forgetting what to press and having to restart. If you determine that the system has a hard time understanding them, the primary prompts from then on out in the flow should over be carried out DTMF (dual-tone multi-frequency, aka button pushing).</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>5. Be nice (but not too nice).</strong> Of course you want to be polite when you’re talking to a customer, but it’s important not to overdo it. Avoid using “please” for every request can become overly repetitious. If a customer completes a simple task like pressing a button, they don’t need to be thanked for it. On the flip side, if a customer has been waiting on hold for 20 minutes and gets connected to an agent, that would be an instance where you’d want to thank them for their patience.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>6. Let customers bypass the system.</strong> For every customer happily using IVR, there’s another customer who would rather speak with a live agent ASAP. Don’t be afraid to give the caller the option to “speak with someone at any time by pressing star.” If you have the ability to channel pivot, you can provide them the option to switch to text message automation instead of voice automation. Avoid going any further than three menus deep&#8211;you will be testing the caller’s patience after that.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>7.  Don’t make the same mistake over and over.</strong> If your customers get tripped up on one IVR step, Increase their chances of successfully navigating the IVR by making sure each re-prompt has different wording. The best practice is to start with voice recognition (e.g. “say Sales, say Support”) and then if unrecognized, give them the choices with different wording, then again in DTMF (“press one, press two”). If customers continue too a hard time with the voice recognition, present prompts from then on out in the flow should over DTMF options instead of voice recognition.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>8. Don’t abandon your IVR.</strong> Just like any other piece of machinery, your IVR needs regular tune-ups to make sure it’s working correctly. If agents are handling more calls than usual or customers are hanging up without going through the IVR, it might be time to reevaluate things. Industry experts recommend reviewing an up-an-running IVR once a month; newer systems should be reviewed on a daily to weekly basis.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>9. Add a personal touch.</strong> After your customer has used your IVR several times, you should start to notice a pattern in his or her behavior. Do they call in the same time every month to schedule an appointment? Are they consistently having trouble with one of your products? Do they call in at a specific time of day? After watching their behavior over a period of time, you should adapt your IVR to suit their needs based on their preferences and interaction history. Customers will appreciate the fact that you respect their time and will be more likely to use your IVR in the future.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Almost every IVR contains one of these frustrating phrases:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><em>“Please listen carefully, as our menu has changed.”</em></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><em>“We are currently assisting other customers. Your call will be answered in the order in which it was received.”</em></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><em>“You can find information on our website at…”</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">When working with an <a href="http://blog.talkdesk.com/what-is-an-ivr-and-6-benefits-of-using-one">integrated voice response (IVR) system</a>, there are a number of things you have to take into consideration. Although IVR lets companies handle multiple customers at once, the prompts can become redundant, driving customers to hang up or bypass the menu altogether.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7160"></span>Customer engagement is crucial in retaining and attracting customers that will continue to do business. Being proactive <a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=34">in reading your customers’ minds</a> is key. Here are a few simple solutions that will help remove these overused IVR phrases from your system for good:</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">“Please listen carefully, as our menu has changed.”</h3>
<p dir="ltr">How many times have customers heard this? Too many. Over <a href="http://onereachcontactcenter.com/high-demand-for-customer-service-via-text-message/">80% of consumers</a> think it’s frustrating to be tied to a phone or computer to wait for customer service help; offering alternatives like text chat lets customers navigate an IVR system in a way that is convenient for them. Another solution would be to place more amicable options earlier in the menu to avoid using this phrase at all.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">“We are currently assisting other customers. Your call will be answered in the order in which it was received.”</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Most systems now instantaneously alert the customer to their number in line and how long their wait will be. Recently, more and more companies have been offering callback options so customers don’t have to wait on hold. However,<a href="http://onereachcontactcenter.com/high-demand-for-customer-service-via-text-message/"> 44% of consumers</a> with texting capabilities would prefer to press a button to initiate a text conversation immediately, rather than waiting on hold to speak with an agent. For companies that are interested in increasing customer satisfaction, integrating texting into your channel mix can be a great way to honor customer preference while freeing up customer service representatives.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">“You can find information on our website at…”</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Most companies have websites in place and customers are already aware of that. While this kind of prompt is well-intentioned, aimed at decreasing the number of incoming calls and providing more self-service, it isn’t necessary here&#8211;they’re calling in for a reason. If your prompts are filled with self-service options that answer additional questions, your customers will be well-informed and won’t have to turn to another channel.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Getting rid of these annoying prompts</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Employing these methods will not only help ban these phrases from your IVR system, but will add efficiency to your processes. Anticipating customer needs and questions prior to them having to look for the information will help your brand and retain customer loyalty. Capitalizing on the advantages of an IVR system will not only enhance the user experience, but improve the call center structure.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">With technological advances flooding the market everyday, interactive voice response (IVR) is looking more and more like a thing of the past.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Modern speech technology dates as far back as the 1930s, but IVRs didn’t really come into their own until the late ‘90s. In theory, customers would be empowered to solve their own problems while agents would be able to handle more pressing calls with IVR. In actuality, this new system caused companies to value speed over service, stressing out agents while creating more and more dissatisfied customers.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7141"></span>For businesses, it’s been a lot cheaper to use IVR over a live agent. A call handled by IVR <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/analystreports/enterprise-application/forrester-tei-atg-359304.pdf">costs an average of 15 cents</a>, while a call handled by a live agent costs an average of $15—a hundred times more expensive than IVR. Using IVR also manages calls more efficiently than a live agent, allowing calls at any time and automatically connecting customers to the solution for their problem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately for customers, IVRs have often created more problems than they solve, like an unsatisfactory experience. Despite its relatively straightforward design, customers are frustrated by the soulless auto attendant and endless rerouting. Only 15% of consumers think IVR use<a href="http://www.interactions.net/2011/06/so-people-hate-ivr-is-this-news-to-anyone/"> benefits them</a>, while 34% think they benefit the company.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Out With The Old, In With The New</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Luckily there’s a solution that benefits everybody—interactive text response, or ITR. Building off of its IVR predecessor, ITR introduces us to a world where businesses get what they want (more business!) while increasing customer satisfaction. Companies can personalize texts and notify customers about orders, prescriptions, you name it, and they can automate messages to save time and money. They also have the benefit of switching to live text chat if a customer wants more information, and are able to handle multiple conversations at once.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Companies can also eliminate one of the customers’ main frustrations (long hold times) with ITR. Customers get their questions answered in real-time without having to sit through the phone tree; in fact, over 80% of customers hate doing that. Texting is also a lot more convenient than phone calls—it’s quieter in a loud location, and customers don’t have to be tied to their phones while waiting for a response. If they do text chat with a live agent, they’re still able to have a two-way conversation without switching to another device.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">ITR In Action</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Organizations ranging from restaurants to schools to banks have already started using texting to contact their customers. Or, in the case of Bowling Green State University, their students. Newly admitted students at BGSU can text chat current students with any questions or concerns they have; over 90% of students choose to opt-in to the program. Students<a href="http://www.bgsu.edu/admissions/next-steps/for-freshmen/entering-summer-term.html"> can also receive text enrollment updates</a> and deadline notification in the weeks leading up to classes. Students like using text because it’s their channel of choice and they ask questions they normally wouldn’t over voice. The school likes it too since because they get more responses than they could with just voice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The important thing to remember about ITR is that it’s interactive—it’s not just one-way communication (even though that’s how it’s been used up until now). Customers hate phone trees because they’re not having an actual dialogue; they’re just pressing buttons. ITR engages the customers in a conversation, automated or live. Having that two-way text communication will end up separating the inactive from the innovators.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People hate IVR, everything from its automated voice to its endless wait times to its frantic button mashing. In fact, only 13% of consumers think IVR <a href="http://www.interactions.net/2011/06/so-people-hate-ivr-is-this-news-to-anyone/">is easy to use</a><b>. </b>Callers can never be sure if they’ll encounter an effective self-service tool, an ineffective self-service tool, or a call routing system. However, most experiences end the same way: with one frustrated customer.</p>
<p>IVRs were originally created to decrease the amount of time an agent had to be on the phone and increase conversions. Unfortunately, they didn’t do as good a job reducing the amount of time for the customer. As companies reaped the financial benefits and agents had more time to work with, customers grew increasingly dissatisfied with the IVR system. Today, only 15% of consumers think IVR use <a href="http://www.interactions.net/2011/06/so-people-hate-ivr-is-this-news-to-anyone/">benefits them</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-7137"></span>Being overly reliant on IVR often comes at the expense of customer experience. Customers call in to resolve a seemingly simple problem like paying a bill and are taken hostage by never-ending wait times and prompts. (Interactions with live service agents aren’t necessarily better—just check out this <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tech/comcast-serves-up-what-may-be-the-worst-customer-91851980684.html">Comcast horror story</a> that’s been circulating the web). We’ve all had bad experiences with IVR self-service, but the truth is, we don’t have to.</p>
<p>IVR can actually be a great (and cost-effective) contact center solution if we let it. <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/analystreports/enterprise-application/forrester-tei-atg-359304.pdf">According to a report by Forrester and Oracle</a>, the average IVR call costs around 15 cents, compared to $15 for a live agent call. The key to using IVR is to make it as easy for the customer as possible to get their problem solved. The pain comes when the self-service fails, or when a customer knows they’re just being asked question to be routed to the appropriate agent. IVRs can offer a great experience. Here are some ways to improve them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong style="color: #000000; font-style: normal;">Add a personal touch. </strong>Customers often have to sit through entire phone menus just to find the option they’re looking for, and they’re tired of it&#8211;over 40% consumers would prefer to have a text conversation immediately vs. waiting on hold. Drawing on data from past interactions can get customers to the option they want a lot quicker and out of phone menu hell.</li>
<li><strong>Keep it simple.</strong> IVR is a pretty basic system: it routes you where you want to go with the push of a button. It’s also very good at answering basic questions like what a store’s hours or address are. Don’t assign the system overcomplicated functions and your customers won’t be disappointed.</li>
<li><strong>Make it useful.</strong> Customers know what they want from an IVR experience, and that’s to get their problem resolved as quickly and easily as possible. Cater to the customer and their needs: for example, instead of making customers start a call over due to an incorrect entry and wasting their time, let them try again.</li>
<li><strong>Let them change channels.</strong> <a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://onereach.com/resources/infographics/OneReach_People_Want_to_Text_Your_Business.jpg">Over 64% of customers</a> prefer texting a contact center over calling them. Give customers the flexibility to switch between phone and text when it suits them without losing track of where they were in the conversation.</li>
</ul>
<p>IVRs may seem cheaper than adding another agent to your team, but don’t forget that improved customer service <a href="http://blogs.salesforce.com/company/2013/07/customer-service-tips.html">correlates to increased profits</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a noble effort to cut costs, many businesses use interactive voice response (IVR) systems at contact centers. While this does lower contact center costs by reducing real-agent answer time, it also reduces customer satisfaction <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/cust-exp-impact-report-epss-1560493.pdf">by a whopping 93% overall</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-7115"></span>Let&#8217;s face it. At one point or another, we have all been frustrated by an annoying IVR system. And we know that endlessly screaming commands into a phone aggravates an already testy customer. The reality is that even though technology has advanced considerably over the years, customers still often want to interact personally with your business.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that automated systems like IVRs have not helped companies develop positive customer relationships. In fact <a href="http://blog.vpi-corp.com/blog/performance-optimization-2/40-stats-shaping-the-future-of-contact-centers">only 7% of customers</a> feel IVRs have provided them with a satisfactory customer service experience.</p>
<p>That is too bad, because research also shows that after a bad customer service experience, <a href="http://blog.vpi-corp.com/blog/performance-optimization-2/40-stats-shaping-the-future-of-contact-centers">86% quit doing business</a> with the offending <a href="http://blog.vpi-corp.com/blog/performance-optimization-2/40-stats-shaping-the-future-of-contact-centers">organization</a>. When it comes down to it, losing good customers due to a bad experience hurts your bottom line more than you saved by employing IVR. Think about the age-old rule: Retaining old customers is way more cost effective than acquiring new ones.</p>
<p>But is the problem with the technology or the implementation? The answer may lie somewhere in between. There are ways that call centers can integrate useful technology while still enhancing customer experience. Here are strategies to make that happen:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Text Chat</b>: More than half of customers prefer to text rather than call. Plus, by implementing text chat you can drastically reduce your contact center costs.<b> </b>A text chat system allows customers to text, while allowing agents to quickly respond through already-established web chat system channels. The added benefits are that the customer still gets to speak directly with a person rather than a robot and agents can manage multiple conversations at a time using a system they already know.</li>
<li><b>Web Chat Automation</b>: If you prefer to use IVR to perform simple tasks or for directive purposes, web chat automation can handle that. Think of it as a way for customers to help themselves. According to a 2013 ZenDesk study, <a href="http://cdn.zendesk.com/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf">53% of customers</a> think it’s important to resolve their own product or service. Automated web chat allows customers to do just that, increasing efficiency for both agents and the customer while decreasing costs.</li>
<li><b>SMS Automation</b>: Automation using text chat can help customers with simple tasks—like resetting their account password or checking an order status—without ever having to speak with a live agent. Customer information can be easily integrated using platforms such as ZenDesk, Twilio, and SalesForce. Of course, it makes sense to include an option to reach a live agent at any time if help is needed. Using text automation, you can reduce call center costs and provide customers with both a positive experience and a very quick resolution.</li>
<li><b>Channel Pivot</b>: To create the best customer experience, companies need to allow customers to transition from one channel to another without missing a beat. We at <a href="http://onereachcontactcenter.com/automation/">OneReach</a> call this the “channel pivot.” Based on a customer’s preference, the task being pursued, or environmental conditions, certain channels are more appropriate than others to accomplish a task. For example, in a sound sensitive environment (like in a meeting or on a bus) pivoting a phone call to a text chat conversation may make the most sense for your customer.</li>
<li><b>Seamless Transitions</b>: In addition to multiple-channel support, companies must also be able to provide a <i>seamless transition</i> from one channel to another. This means pivoting not just the client, but their conversation history and relevant information as well. According to the Zendesk study, <a href="http://cdn.zendesk.com/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf">only 7% of customers</a> are extremely satisfied that brands provide a seamless, integrated, and consistent customer service experience across channels. It is important to make sure that if you pivot customers to a different channel, you are still providing them with a good experience. Don’t make your customers repeat themselves when switching channels, and allow them to pivot back if necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Customer experience is still considered the most important element of business operations. Yet most companies seem to implement technology for their own benefit rather than that of the customer. Only when businesses start to focus instead on the user’s experience and build their technology solutions around that will they finally improve customer loyalty, boost their Net Promoter Scores and meet their goals. Even if they have to tame a few robots along the way.</p>
