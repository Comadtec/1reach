								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>While far from a perfect replacement for humans, artificial intelligence is getting smarter. And fast. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, New York Times hailed Google’s new translator as “the great AI awakening,” a trend that has proven itself time and time again during 2017. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wireless headphones that can translate in 40 different languages? You can thank Google, again, for that. Although translation might seem one of the first industries at risk, the truth is that AI is planning a grand entrance to workplaces in a variety of niches. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while it might not replace your job (yet), there’s a good chance you’ll be asked to embrace it with open arms as a co-worker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deemed to be “plucky young assistants on steroids”, the promise of AI for corporations looking to increase productivity while decreasing financial output (just to name a few reasons) is bright enough that you’ll need to put on your sunglasses, and soon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the odds that AI coworkers will lead to workplace utopia, rather than leaving countless unemployed? Time will tell.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>“If you think of neural networks as a software stack and not just a pretty good classifier, it becomes quickly apparent that they have a huge number of advantages and a lot of potential for transforming software in general.”</i></b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reinterpreting the way you understand neural networks will completely change the way you think of software. And, according to Andrej Karpathy, the Director of AI at Tesla, it’s for the best. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coined “Software 2.0”, which is written by neural network weights rather than humans, these weights will not replace Software 1.0 (much to the relief of today’s coders). Instead, Software 2.0 will help to lighten the load, taking on tedious tasks involved in creating the software behind visual and speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, robotics, and games. Karpathy’s argument for the numerous benefits of porting complex programs into Software 2.0, despite its recognized limitations, should be enough to convince any coder to accept this new age transition.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>&#8220;Why Your Mobile Strategy Isn&#8217;t Complete Without Text Messaging&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://onereach.com/img/resource_mobile_strategy_book.jpg" /></p>
<p>In today’s world, customer service is no longer restricted to a simple phone call. A recent report from Dimension Data found that digital interactions account for 35% of all contact center interactions. Digital interactions are also increasingly becoming mobile&#8211;Pew Research found that over 64% of American adults now own a smartphone, up from 35% in 2011.</p>
<p>To meet consumers’ demand for mobile and digital experiences, many businesses are developing apps. But while apps are a highly-used communication channel, the upfront cost and predominant use of gaming and social apps don’t justify the investment.</p>
<p>This is why texting is such an essential part of your mobile strategy. It’s fast, it can be professional but personal, it’s easy to use, it’s in real-time, it picks up where you left off, it connects to the Internet, etc. With texting, businesses can engage with customers on a channel they prefer, while keeping costs down and satisfaction up.</p>
<p>In this whitepaper, we’ll dive into:</p>
<ul>
<li>how and why people are using apps, and what that means for your business</li>
<li>why an app may not be the best channel to engage with customers</li>
<li>how texting fills in the gaps of an app-centric strategy</li>
<li>case studies of companies using texting to great success</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>&#8220;The High Demand for Customer Service via Text Message&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://onereach.com/img/resource_highdemand_book.jpg" /></p>
<p>Historically, companies have incorporated texting into their business strategy for outbound marketing or reminder blasts, using short codes. However, this is not how people experience texting in their personal lives.</p>
<blockquote><p>64% of consumers with texting capabilities would <strong>prefer to use texting over voice</strong> as a customer service channel.</p></blockquote>
<p>One emerging customer service channel—texting via SMS—is turning out to be more important than previously thought. To find out exactly what customers would like most from the customer service text channel, Harris Interactive conducted a nation-wide survey of over 2000 adults on behalf of OneReach. Some key overall findings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>64%</strong> of consumers with texting capabilities would <strong>prefer to use texting over voice</strong>as a customer service channel.</li>
<li><strong>44%</strong> of consumers with texting capabilities would <strong>prefer to press a button to initiate a text conversation immediately, rather than waiting on hold</strong> to speak with an agent.</li>
<li><strong>77%</strong> of consumers with texting capabilities aged 18-34 are likely to have a <strong>positive perception of a company that offers text capability</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>81%</strong> of all consumers agree that it is <strong>frustrating to be tied to a phone or computer to wait</strong> for customer service help.</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>72% of business execs believe AI will be the business advantage of the future.</strong></p>
<p>Technology is great at interrupting the everyday norm, especially when it comes to business. But perhaps no other sector of business is in greater need of reinvention than management, which is tasked with the bulk of a company’s work.</p>
<p>In order to keep up with the demand, management teams are finding creative ways to implement AI, optimizing processes and making better use of their limited time. And, according to a Digital IQ survey done recently, it’s not just some management teams strategizing with AI, it’s more than half.</p>
<p>54% of business executives making “substantial investments” in AI today, and that number is only predicted to continue its rapid growth trend.</p>
<p>Among the AI innovations these execs are most excited to take advantage of are:</p>
<p>The ability to have full-time virtual personal assistants (31%)<br />
Automating data analysis (29%)<br />
Automating email communication and utilizing chatbots (28%)</p>
<p>By freeing up their time by allowing AI to take care of the most repetitive tasks, management executives can focus more on big ideas, helping their companies grow more rapidly and efficiently.</p>
