<p><em>This guest post is written by Matthew Olszewski, a Polish writer who covers topics surrounding personal development, psychology and business. </em></p>
<p><span id="more-2204"></span>If you want to stand out from your competition, it isn’t enough to have a high quality product. Many companies have realized the fact that the market isn’t as important as the customers. In addition, the present market is maturing, and acquiring new customers is getting harder. Therefore, it is more profitable to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones. According to experts, maintaining a loyal customer costs a company much less than acquire a new one. These costs are mainly related to marketing, selling and adapting to meet new customer needs. Losing customers means losing not only losing their profits from one transaction, but all purchases which he could make in the future.</p>
<p>Gaining customer loyalty is something very precious. Satisfied customers that are associated with the company for many years, should be the ultimate goal of any company’s activities. This approach is increasingly characterized by forward-thinking companies. Even small entrepreneurs see an opportunity for additional earnings the more they care about their customers.</p>
<p>Each employee should be able to create and satisfy customer needs. However, not every employee is fit to work with customers. The person who is responsible for the company’s relationships with customers, should have the appropriate knowledge, skills and a high work ethic. The following infographic made by <a href="http://www.mattsfactor.com/skills/customer-service-skills/">mattsfactor.com</a> represents the most basic customer service skills. This is obviously a small part of knowledge that as an entrepreneur you should know. I hope that the tips on presented infographic are so practical that you will be able to use them immediately.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy Friday! Here’s our picks for the best customer service, customer experience, bot and mobile articles of the week, in no particular order.</p>
<h2><span id="more-7440"></span></h2>
<h2><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/enriquedans/2016/07/13/right-now-artificial-intelligence-is-the-only-thing-that-matters-look-around-you/#6f20d34b2480">Right Now, Artificial Intelligence is the Only Thing That Matters</a>&#8211; <a href="http://@edans">by Enrique Dans</a></h2>
<p>Machine learning and artificial intelligence are the keys to almost every aspect of life in the very near future: every sector, every business. Read on to find out how to integrate artificial intelligence for smarter business communication.</p>
<h2><a href="http://digiday.com/brands/two-months-1-800-flowers-facebook-bot-working/">Two Months in: How the 1-800 Flowers Facebook Bot is Working Out</a>&#8211; <a href="http://@digiday">by Grace Caffyn</a></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">You&#8217;ve heard all the hype around bots, but just exactly how are bots doing? According to this article, most customers, mainly millennials prefer to interact with a robot rather than a human. Surprisingly, </span><span style="font-size: medium;">the people using this bot are attracting younger audience. </span></p>
<h2><a href="http://www.mycustomer.com/community/blogs/denispombriant/the-four-attributes-of-customer-loyalty-the-role-of-automation-in">The Four Attributes of Customer Loyalty</a> &#8211;<a href="http://@DenisPombriant">by Denis Prombriant </a></h2>
<p>This is the first of four articles, discussing a trait that makes up the best customer loyalty. The first major attribute- AUTOMATION. At OneReach we believe automation is key, whether for creating  bots or enabling logic based routing. Automation&#8217;s purpose is to trim down on labor and maximize the role of the resources companies invest.</p>

<p>With the phone starting to take a back seat for communication regarding issues or questions, self-service is, and will, continue to grow in the future. As technology improves for automated assistants, customers are becoming more comfortable to not have to interact with an actual human being.</p>

<h2><span id="more-7439"></span></h2>
<h2><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/03/what-businesses-need-to-understand-about-chatbots/?ncid=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29&amp;sr_share=facebook">What Businesses Need to Understand about Chatbots</a>&#8211; by <a href="http://@LirazMargalit">Liraz Margalit </a></h2>
<p>You have been slammed with the topic of bots and the details of them, but why do businesses need to understand them? Bots have the potential to provide greater conveniences than apps because they can understand &#8220;natural speech patterns and provide the personal touch in an impersonal user interface.&#8221; If understood and utilized correctly, chatbots have the power to help business grow in many ways.</p>

<p>Most businesses have implemented the use of social media as a way to interact with customers, however, there’s an additional source of reach and power that many firms aren’t aware of, so it largely remains untapped: personal brands. Read more to identify the advantages and potentially improve your customer strategy.</p>

<p>The experience a customer has with a company will, more times than not, determine if that customer returns to the brand or takes their business elsewhere. Providing great experiences for your customers doesn&#8217;t end with your front line, it&#8217;s the entire company&#8217;s responsibility. See how every department within a company can (and should) get involved.</p>

<h2><span id="more-7438"></span></h2>
<h2><span style="font-size: x-large;"><a href="http://customerthink.com/customer-centricity-is-more-than-promotional-hype/">Customer-Centricity is more than Promotional Hype</a> &#8211; by Mitchell Goozé</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">How do companies drive emotional engagement and guarantee they are fully committed to the needs of the customer? According to this article, centricity is key. Providing better customer service will ultimately end up in more profit, which is almost always the end goal for companies. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: x-large;"><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ibm/2016/06/20/how-to-architect-a-cognitive-future-for-business/#305197e0b173">How to Architect a Cognitive Future for Business </a> &#8211; by <a href="http://@TomRosamilia">Tom Rosamilia</a></span></h2>
<p>Many businesses are looking at the wide-spread possibilities of artificial intelligence to redefine their industries, businesses and customers. Business leaders are embracing artificial intelligence because consumers are using cognitive applications through phones and in their cars, creating better customer engagement.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: x-large;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/21/the-hidden-risks-of-the-bot-explosion/">The Hidden Risks of the Bot Explosion</a>&#8211; by <a href="http://@JenniferLSnell">Jennifer Snell</a> </span></h2>
<p>Whenever something new is introduced people are naturally skeptical about jumping into it. Building trust between humans and machines is very important and, like any relationship, takes time. People will only trust their bots if they trust the makers of their bots. At OneReach we want to make sure customers trust that we’re acting responsibly behind the curtain, and that we value the significance of their customer experience.</p>

<p>The newest technologies have an amazing capacity to make customer service more effective. Knowing that 40% of customers prefer to handle issues on their own, technology can reduce the effort put forth in order to get their issues resolved.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This guest post is written by <i>Stephan Delbos</i>, <i>Editor &amp; Content Manager at </i><a href="http://www.brandembassy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Brand Embassy</i></a><i>.</i></em></p>
<p>The hype surrounding Facebook’s chatbot announcement made it seem like some people were envisioning a <i>Transformers</i>-like takeover of customer service by bots. The introduction of chatbots into digital customer service is great because bots are fast and very efficient. But humans still have a huge role to play in customer service and always will. It might be less dramatic than a chatbot coup d&#8217;état, but the future of customer service lies in the balance between automation and human connections. Knowing the undeniable advantages of chatbots and making use of them, while also giving human agents the freedom to connect with customers will be the key to providing responsive, personalized service that delights customers and inspires their loyalty.</p>
<p>Many commentators look back on pre-internet customer service as the good old days, with real people helping people and developing long-term relationships. The internet, the narrative goes, put up a wall between brands and customers, making digital customer service potentially faster, but far less personal. The solution to that conundrum certainly isn’t to stop using technology — <a href="http://www.brandembassy.com/blog/why-chatbots-will-not-replace-contact-centers"><b>chatbots</b></a><b> and digital customer care can be key differentiators</b>, because they allow brands to streamline and simplify customer service at scale.</p>
<p>But we’ve reached a tipping point, when everyone is starting to realize the importance of customer experience, and that brands need to step out from behind that digital wall. <b>83% of U.S. consumers prefer dealing with </b><a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/us-companies-losing-customers-as-consumers-demand-more-human-interaction-accenture-strategy-study-finds.htm"><b>human beings</b></a> over digital channels to solve customer services issues, according to new research from Accenture. It’s not that technology is suddenly useless. On the contrary, chatbots and advanced customer service technology are more important than ever before. In fact, the smartest brands will actually use automation to put the human back into the customer service equation.</p>
<h2><b>The beginning of a beautiful friendship</b></h2>
<p>We love technology and we’re big fans of innovation. Anything that could possibly help brands serve their customers better sounds fantastic to us. But technology alone can’t provide excellent customer service, because customers want personalized human connections. That’s why <b>52% of </b><a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/us-companies-losing-customers-as-consumers-demand-more-human-interaction-accenture-strategy-study-finds.htm"><b>consumers</b></a><b> have switched brands in the past year</b> due to poor customer service, which includes brands that made it difficult to get in touch with a human customer service agent. Bots are invaluable, especially when customers also have the opportunity to speak with an empathetic, responsive human.</p>
<p>Think of the popular stories you’ve heard about great customer service, from Zappos to Netflix or Hilton. It’s hard to imagine these being orchestrated by chatbots alone. But it’s also hard to imagine this extraordinary level of customer service being possible if agents didn’t have advanced technology at their fingertips.</p>
<p>The advantages of automation in customer service are too large to ignore. We have the technology, so why not use it? <b>The key is knowing when to use automation and when to rely on humans.</b> Doing so requires a clear-eyed consideration of what humans do best, and what should be left up to bots.</p>
<h2><b>What should be automated?</b></h2>
<p>Great customer service in the 21st century just isn’t possible without technology. Chatbots have all the advantages of computers: they’re fast and they’re rational. In the future, contact centers will take advantage of all that chatbots have to offer, but will only rely on them to do the things they’re best at, the 1st-level contacts for repetitive questions and issues that are easy to solve. There are exciting opportunities for brands who know how to make automation work for them.</p>
<p>As a basic bottom line, <b>all brands should offer proactive live chat.</b> Automated chatbots will seek out customers browsing the website and contact them based on what they are looking at. This kind of proactivity has positive effects on sales and customer satisfaction, but is often too much of a burden for human agents to take on, especially when there are many customers and a small team. Bots can free agents to do more important things.</p>
<p><b>Intelligent ticket routing is another vital feature</b> of automated customer service. Intelligent routing, particularly in <a href="http://www.brandembassy.com">digital customer service</a> where expectations for quick response and personalization are high, is a great way to utilize the best of both worlds. Brands have automation to select the best possible customer service agent, and a human touch to personalize the experience. It’s a question of using technology to lead customers to human agents if and when they need it.</p>
<h2><b>What needs a human touch? </b></h2>
<p>In the future, <a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/human-customer-service-still-valued-by-customers/">human agents</a> will focus on complex issues, and will use their emotional intelligence and instinct whenever they can. Essentially, technology will take care of the technical stuff, freeing up human agents to do what they do best. This will be a systematic change in the way we think about and execute digital customer service.</p>
<p>To cultivate the human touch in digital customer service, brands have to do three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recognize the importance of empathy</li>
<li>Make personal connections</li>
<li>Provide repeat contact points</li>
</ul>
<p><b>83% of </b><a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/us-companies-losing-customers-as-consumers-demand-more-human-interaction-accenture-strategy-study-finds.htm"><b>American customers</b></a><b> who have switched brands</b> say that better live or in-person customer service would have inspired them to stay. Customer service should be less about “satisfying” customers and more about moving them smoothly through the service experience time after time. But even earlier, before making a sale, chatbots can get in touch with the customer and guide them along. <b>Bots take care of the easily solvable problems, leading customers to qualified agents</b> who can then develop and sustain relationships with customers over time, which means increased loyalty and distinguishing customer experience.</p>

<p>Customer service has evolved a lot in the past few decades. Support interactions used to be limited to just a phone call, but now customers can reach a company over email, social media and even text message. Self-service is an option to make customers’ lives easier, but it&#8217;s not a substitute for good customer service.</p>

<p>As technology continues to advance, machines will be able to carry out a big number of tasks normally handled by humans. Businesses should really prioritize where robots are best used vs humans who have innovated solutions.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This guest post is written by Jeremy Watkin, Head of Quality at <a href="http://gofcr.com">FCR</a>.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m a huge baseball fan— a Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim fan to be exact. In baseball, the order in which the players bat is called a “lineup.” The general rule of thumb is that the first batter, or leadoff hitter, is one of the best players at getting on base— either by hit or walk. This person also tends to be one of the faster players, so when they do get on base, they can both steal bases and score on hits where the slower players wouldn’t be able to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s go ahead and take this analogy and mosey on over to customer service. Imagine that our customers are pitching to us and the questions they are asking are the pitches. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing you should know about baseball is that most major leaguers have no problem hitting a fastball— especially if it’s right down the middle and they know it’s coming. It’s often the pitches that move around a lot, like the curveball and slider, that keep hitters off balance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We tend to be good at answering the fastball questions from customers. After all, we are well-trained customer service experts for the product or service we support. It’s the curveballs that give us fits. Think about the questions we either don’t know the answer to or know we specifically can’t accommodate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s in those moments that we so often take the wrong approach at the plate. We generally approach those curveballs with words like unfortunately, no, sorry, can’t, I don’t know, and a variety of other negative responses. More times than not, responding to our customers in this manner is a sure way to strike out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When customers consistently throw their best curveballs, and they will, it’s important to have our best responses ready to go. While this is important for all customer service channels, it’s all the more important for the text-based ones like email, SMS, and social media where we may only get one chance to respond— on behalf of the entire company! Clearly this is something we should practice ahead of time.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Practice hitting the curveball (AKA answer tough questions)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to hitting the curveball, sometimes it’s all in your approach. The approach I’ve seen (and done) over and over again is the one where we respond telling the customer we can’t do something. Hypothetically speaking, let’s say we work for a company that sells widgets and a customer asks if we can overnight ship a widget to them. Knowing full well that we don’t offer overnight shipping, the typical approach is to say something like:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m so sorry but unfortunately we don’t offer overnight shipping at this time. Thank you so much for contacting us. Have a nice day.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that point we’ve essentially struck out. The response focused on what we couldn’t do with no focus on what we could do. Whether the customer states it or not, they are forced to either wait or take their business elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a professional hitter, let’s change our approach and see if we can hit the curveball this next time. Here’s a response that focuses on what we can do for the customer:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you so much for your interest in our widgets! I&#8217;ve provided a few of my personal favorites below as you search for your favorite. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In regards to our shipping, we&#8217;ve found that our order fulfillment time is so quick that customers often receive their items faster than our estimates. While we don&#8217;t specifically offer overnight shipping, let me know if you have any flexibility on the date you need to receive this by. I want to get a fresh, new widget out to you and will do what I can to make that happen as soon as possible.</span></i></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Play by Play</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you see what I did there on my second response? Like a good baseball analyst, let’s break it down:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b><b>Show Ownership- </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">After thanking the customer for their inquiry and gently sharing some suggestions with them, I very softly touched on the fact that I couldn’t do exactly what they were asking. I did however let them know that I was there to help connect them with a solution.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Begin a Dialog- </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my first reply, I told the customer I couldn’t help them&#8230;PERIOD. That’s effectively the end of the discussion unless the customer wants to argue with me and tell me I’m wrong. In my second approach, I sought to find an alternate solution for them that we could easily support. Perhaps the customer didn’t need overnight shipping, that just happened to be the only possible option they saw. If they needed the item in 2-3 days, that’s a big difference and I, as the expert on my product, can determine if we can accommodate that.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Solution-minded- </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In welcoming the customer’s response, I’ve shown myself to be open and receptive to what they have to say. In some cases, the customer will have more flexibility than we initially assumed. If the customer does respond stating that they need it by tomorrow, our company then has a decision to make. This is a great place to employ the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 to say yes, 2 to say no </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">principle. Rather than responding and saying “Unfortunately there’s nothing I can do,” ask someone in leadership if there’s something we can do. What if the customer’s willing to pay extra for the expedited shipping?</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The point of this is that we are finding ways to do business with customers and solve their problems. That’s a good thing. While there are certainly times to say no to customers, we say no far too often where even just a little flexibility and understanding would create a customer for life.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Practice Makes Perfect</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s try a few more statements on for size before we end this post. I’ll present the negative and then the positive:</span></p>
<h4><b><i>Question: What’s the status of my order?</i></b></h4>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Negative Answer: Unfortunately your order is still in our warehouse because it was delayed by a day.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive Answer: Thank you so much for your patience with your order. It is shipping today. If you haven’t received tracking information to your email, it should be there very soon. I hope this information helps.</span></i></p>
<p><b><i>Question: My online order status says “backordered.” When will I receive it?</i></b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Negative Answer: Unfortunately, your order is indeed backordered and will be unavailable for another month or so.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive Answer: I’m sorry for the delay in fulfilling this order. It looks like we will be able to ship your product out to you in about a month. If this order is more urgent than that, here are some other products that are very similar that we do have in stock right now. Let me know if you’d like to order one of those instead.</span></i></p>
<p><b><i>Question: Why is my credit card being declined?</i></b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Negative Answer: There are many reasons your credit card might be declined. Are you sure there’s enough money in your account. You are going to need to contact your bank.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive Answer: I’m sorry your credit card is being declined. That’s frustrating and we really want you to be able to use our service as soon as possible. I would suggest contacting your bank to see if they have information about the decline. If they say everything is ok, give us a call and we’ll help you try your card again.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My eternally optimistic colleague, Hammer Winn helped me in writing this article and so it’s only fitting to quote him as we think about adopting a more positive mindset in our responses to others:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This approach not only changes the tone of the interaction, but also creates a customer for life. Practicing this positive approach not only improves your customer service but also has the power to improve your life and relationships.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a moment to think about some of your responses throughout each day and find ways to rewrite them so they focus on a solution, show ownership, and encourage dialog with the customer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To slightly modify a quote from the great baseball player, Mark McGwire, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers dig the long ball. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn to hit the curveball and you will hit more home runs with your customers.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This guest post is written by Jen Diaz, Program Manager at <a href="http://irrevo.com">Irrevo</a>.</em></p>
<p>Stories of outrageously amazing customer service catch a lot of attention, whether or not they’re actually true. Everyone has heard the legend of the fellow who returned a snow tire to Nordstrom, even though the story that’s passed around is missing some context. If some <a href="https://consumerist.com/2011/12/02/home-depot-staff-makes-8-hour-trip-to-find-me-a-snow-blower/">Home Depot</a> employees drive four hours each way to find you a snowblower, you’d be a happy snowbird. But studies show that customers and business owners don’t always see eye-to-eye on the definition of good customer service.</p>
<p><span id="more-7428"></span>Research conducted by Bain &amp; Company found that 80% of CEOs believe they deliver a superior customer experience, while only 8% of their customers agree. This huge disconnect in perception holds companies back from providing truly “wow”-worthy customer service. However, there’s one question that can close that gap…</p>
<p><strong>Ask your customers “How?” </strong></p>
<p>Good customer service has to be measured using customer feedback. The CEO’s perception of the service his/her company provides matters little. Stakeholders may know that their offer or experience is the best in the industry, but if customers don’t perceive it as such, the end result is dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>For example, Company A offers long-term customers a free product from their new line when their old one breaks, while their competitors do not. Company A’s leadership can quantify that they are going above and beyond what’s required, or even expected. In this case, leadership has made two assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best in class is best for the customer</li>
<li>Free things = good customer service</li>
</ul>
<p>Countless studies have shown that customers value service over cost. One oft-quoted statistic: 7 in 10 customers would pay more to receive better service. Company A is providing what looks like a great customer experience, but if their stakeholders included the voice of the customer in their decision-making process, they may come to a different conclusion.</p>
<p>What does lead to customer satisfaction? That magic question isn’t answered in the boardroom or on a blog. The voice of the customer speaks in words and phrases, not in 1-5 ratings.</p>
<ul>
<li>How can we resolve your issue?</li>
<li>How can we improve our service?</li>
<li>How did we miss the chance to knock your socks off?</li>
</ul>
<p>Traditional CSAT surveys ignore these questions, or include them as optional, once a customer has provided a 1-10 rating of their satisfaction. Without having specific answers to the How questions above, customer service teams are left to guess at what drives performance. “Is there anything else you’d like to tell us about your experience?” should never be an afterthought.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s an exciting time to be involved the customer service and communications space. There are more ways to interact with a brand than ever before (email, Twitter, even Snapchat), but one of the most new and exciting advancements is chatbots.</p>
<p><span id="more-7420"></span>In a recent article, The Guardian described chatbots as:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Chat bots are computer programs that mimic conversation with people using artificial intelligence. They can transform the way you interact with the internet from a series of self-initiated tasks to a quasi-conversation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In the customer service space, chatbots are using the growing power of artificial intelligence to allow customers to interact with a brand as they would with a customer service representative. However, there are some marked benefits to managing conversations with chatbots. Read on to find out why.</p>
<h2><strong>Chatbots are where the market is trending. </strong></h2>
<p>Last year, Uber’s director of experience Chris Messina wrote a post hailing the rise of something he called <a href="https://medium.com/chris-messina/2016-will-be-the-year-of-conversational-commerce-1586e85e3991#.jzhm93htd">conversational commerce</a>. He described it as:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Utilizing chat, messaging, or other natural language interfaces (i.e. voice) to interact with people, brands, or services and bots that heretofore have had no real place in the bidirectional, asynchronous messaging context.”</p></blockquote>
<p>His vision of conversational commerce has come to fruition this year with the exciting and not unrelated rise of bots. Messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger and Kik recently doubled down on chatbots, rolling out their own bot stores where developers can go in and code their own conversational chatbots.</p>
<p>While initial reaction to the chatbots has been somewhat lukewarm (their ability to handle natural language leaves something to be desired), we have to remember we’re just at the beginning of a very exciting evolution of B2C communications. In fact, Gartner made a prediction a few years back that by 2020, <a href="http://mktimages.gartner.com/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_92DB197B681D1A1003F701CB30B626FF3B111B00/filename/brochure_crm_2011.pdf">85% of customer interactions</a> would be managed without a human. The rise of chatbots dovetails nicely into this prediction.</p>
<h2><strong>Customers are open to the idea of chatbots.</strong></h2>
<p>While there’s still something to be said for a human touch in customer service, research has shown that 40% of <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/stevenvanbelleghem/the-self-serving-economy">customers prefer self-service</a>. In addition, Zendesk found that <a href="http://cdn.zendesk.com/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf">over 50% of customers</a> think it’s important that they can solve their problems themselves without having to rely on customer service agents.</p>
<p>Customers are also interested in interacting with your business over messaging (and already are). <a href="https://onereach.com/resources/high-demand-for-text-message-2014-report">A study</a> conducted by Harris Poll and commissioned by OneReach found that 64% of customers would rather text than call your business, and insights released during the <a href="http://www.edelman.com/83621/2016/04/15/facebook-messenger-for-business-brands-chatbots/">recent F8 Conference</a> showed that more than one billion messages are sent to businesses each month.</p>
<p>Combine the two approaches (self-service and texting/messaging) and you arrive at chatbots. Chatbots leverage a channel that customers are already using (texting/messaging) and blend it with their desire for a self-service experience.</p>
<h2><strong>Chatbots are cheaper and faster than live agents.</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve talked before about how much cheaper an automated interaction is compared to a live agent interaction (25 cents vs. $6-20). But in addition to being cheaper than live agents, chatbots are also an efficient way to deliver customer service—customers can type in their question and get a response back almost immediately based on pre-programmed logic.</p>
<p>For instance, I recently tried out Spring, one of the first Facebook Messenger bots to go public. It asked me if I wanted women’s or men’s items, then asked what kind of clothing I was looking for, all in rapid succession. Soon I was scrolling through results quickly and easily.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2601 size-medium" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chatbots2-250x300.png" alt="chatbots2" width="250" height="300" /></p>
<p>Just like with Spring, most people will and are using chatbots for simple requests (getting a ride via Uber, ordering flowers, etc.), but sometimes customers may have more complex queries than the bot can understand. Going back to the Spring example, I found a cardigan I liked (it’s still kind of chilly in Denver, okay?) but wanted to know if they had it in a different color. When I asked the chatbot if they had it in white, the bot kindly told me they’d get back to me soon with an answer.<br />
<img class="wp-image-2600 size-medium aligncenter" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chatbots-250x300.png" alt="chatbots" width="250" height="300" /></p>
<p>By pivoting to a conversation with a live agent from within the bot conversation, you can ensure that every customer has a great experience.</p>
<h2><strong>Chatbots can incorporate visual media.</strong></h2>
<p>Humans are very visual creatures—in fact, <a href="http://info.shiftelearning.com/blog/bid/350326/Studies-Confirm-the-Power-of-Visuals-in-eLearning">we process images 60,000 times faster</a> than we do text. Images are a quick and easy way to communicate information, so that’s why it’s great that chatbots can incorporate rich media like picture and GIFs into conversation. While chatbots primarily communicate through text, images can help chatbots seem more human or showcase a product that’s easier to display than describe.</p>
<p>When I was talking with the Spring bot, once I had determined what types of products I was looking for, it pulled up a few options that I could click on and expand to get more information. There was also the option to add in images and GIFs on my end, and while the chatbot itself didn’t add in an image, I think it could have benefitted the interaction quite a bit and made it seem a little more human.</p>
<h2><strong>It’s almost indistinguishable from a human (when written correctly).</strong></h2>
<p>Your worst fear about chatbots might be that they deliver a clunky, robotic user experience (or, on a more existential level, that they’re coming for all of us and our jobs). However, bots can actually deliver a really seamless, natural human experience when written correctly.</p>
<p>It really depends on what your brand’s voice is, though. If you’re a more informal brand, using slang and casual language (“like,” “love,” etc.) and referring to your brand as “we” or “I” will work well. If you’re a more formal brand, referring to yourself in third person and dropping the slang is probably a better bet.</p>
<p>Spring was more informal, so when the chatbot greeted me with “Hey there!” and referred to itself as “We,” it sounded pretty similar to a human. I almost couldn’t tell the difference between the bot’s responses (left) and the human’s responses (right) when they stepped in.<br />
