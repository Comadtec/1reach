								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Conversational AI: Go Beyond Chatbots with Intelligent Customer and Employee Experiences</strong></p>
<p>In this webinar we attempt to go around the chatbot hype. With conversational AI, your customers and employees get the answers they need fast. It’s more than simple “if-then” logic; it incorporates natural language to make human-to-machine conversations more like human-to-human ones. The result? Increased customer engagement, continued trust and reliability in your business, and the ability to free up your best thinkers and doers to become more productive than ever before.</p>
<p><strong>Watch webinar recording to learn how to:</strong><br />
&#8211; Automatically parse data, intent, and tasks from customer interactions using the power of Anypoint Platform combined with no-code/low-code conversational AI solutions from <a href="https://onereach.ai">OneReach.ai</a><br />
&#8211; Build task-specific, channel-agnostic experiences by integrating data from systems and channels like Slack, SMS, Voice, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger.<br />
&#8211; Retool your team for operational efficiency by automating the known, handing off the unknown, and more.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Artificial intelligence is reshaping business—though not at the blistering pace many assume. True, AI is now guiding decisions on everything from crop harvests to bank loans, and once pie-in-the-sky prospects such as totally automated customer service are on the horizon. The technologies that enable AI, like development platforms and vast processing power and data storage, are advancing rapidly and becoming increasingly affordable. The time seems ripe for companies to capitalize on AI. Indeed, we estimate that AI will add $13 trillion to the global economy over the next decade.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the promise of AI, many organizations’ efforts with it are falling short. We’ve surveyed thousands of executives about how their companies use and organize for AI and advanced analytics, and our <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/breaking-away-the-secrets-to-scaling-analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data shows</a> that only 8% of firms engage in core practices that support widespread adoption. Most firms have run only <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/ai-adoption-advances-but-foundational-barriers-remain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ad hoc pilots</a> or are applying AI in just a single business process.</p>
<p>Why the slow prog­ress? At the highest level, it’s a reflection of a failure to rewire the organization. In our surveys and our work with hundreds of clients, we’ve seen that AI initiatives face formidable cultural and organizational barriers. But we’ve also seen that leaders who at the outset take steps to break down those barriers can effectively capture AI’s opportunities.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Chatbots — automated conversation systems — have become increasingly sophisticated. Should you design and deploy one that can interact with your customers? If you’re an executive making that decision right now, you may feel caught between A.I. hype on the one hand, and the fear that machines might not treat your customers right on the other.</p>
<p>Chatbots are a broad category that includes everything from Amazon Alexa smart speakers to automated text chat on a company’s customer service page. The most powerful chatbots — and the ones that can actually make an impact on customers’ experience and company bottom lines — are virtual agents. These are chatbots powered by an artificial intelligence that can understand and answer a wide variety of customer questions.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Artificial intelligence (AI) can augment or automate decisions and tasks today performed by humans, making it indispensable for digital business transformation. With AI, organizations can reduce labor costs, generate new business models, and improve processes or customer service. However, most AI technologies remain immature.</p>
<p>“To overcome this hurdle, CIOs must ensure that applications intended to serve a strategic business purpose, such as increasing revenue or scaling services, are designed for strategic plans,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/20865" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jorge Lopez</a>, Distinguished Vice President Analyst, Gartner.</p>
<h5>&#8220;AI generates insights that lead directly to business execution.&#8221;</h5>
<p>Lopez outlines six design principles that will help CIOs and organizations evaluate all proposed AI applications with strategic intent — that is, applications intended to help achieve business results, not just operational improvements. Applications do not have to follow all six principles; however, designs that show two or fewer principles should be reconsidered&#8230;&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Despite working in the human resources for over eight years for some of the top organizations in Canada, I have been somewhat blind to the future of work being driven by automation and artificial intelligence (AI). That is, until I read the <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018.pdf">2018 Future of Jobs report</a> by World Economic Forum.</p>
<p>According to that report, 50% of companies expect that by 2022, their full-time workforce will be somewhat reduced by automation. It is alarming to note that nearly a quarter of these companies are undecided or unlikely to retrain their existing employees and two-thirds expect workers to retrain themselves. This expectation raises an important question of how employees could know which new jobs they should retrain for when these jobs have not yet been created.&#8221;</p>
