								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July of 2013 Toby Shapshak, the South African speaker, strategist and editor of Stuff Magazine, did a TED talk called </span><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/toby_shapshak_you_don_t_need_an_app_for_that?language=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You Don’t Need An App For That</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Business leaders, innovators and experience designers would soon realize how profound this TED talk was to the rest of the world. Shapshak’s astute observations and message to the rest of the world was years ahead of a revolution that Forbes would call </span><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2016/02/23/chat-bots-facebook-telegram-wechat/#5c9ad9142633"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“the new way we’ll be interacting with computers.”</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toby’s 2013 Ted talk touted that “while the rest of the world is updating statuses and playing games on smartphones, Africa is developing useful SMS-based solutions to everyday needs”. Since 2013 his TED talk has been viewed 1,438,046 times as of July 19, 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward a couple of years and we see more apps than anyone knows what to do with, as well as a notable decrease in</span><a href="http://onereach.com/blog/infographic-mobile-apps-vs-text-messaging/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> usage and app-downloads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This has businesses confused and frustrated. Meanwhile, around the world, messaging (SMS and the ever-encroaching uptake of IP messaging &#8211; Facebook Messenger, Spark, Slack, Kik, SnapChat, etc) is by far the most used function or app on mobile phones &#8211; smart phone or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2016 brought a wave of new businesses and products that fall into the category of </span><a href="http://onereach.com/blog/why-your-business-needs-a-bot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; chat bots, messaging-bots, </span><a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/humans-ai-and-the-user-interface-of-the-future"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conversational-bots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “invisible apps” or &#8220;conversational commerce”. Messaging-bots are popping up for everything, increasingly displacing mobile-apps. New bots are being brought to life daily by startups and household brands alike. Whether the experiences are where they need to be or not, bots existing today which allow you to order a </span><a href="http://onereach.com/blog/i-tried-ordering-dominos-over-text-message-and-it-was-a-total-disaster/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pizza</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, make a payment, read the </span><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/04/media/new-york-times-text-message/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, be reminded of an appointment or even make an appointment. Even </span><a href="http://onereach.com/blog/cities-offer-text-311/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">city and county municipalities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are seeing the value, for example, Washington DC uses a </span><a href="https://onereach.com/bots/#dc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bot for their 311</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">-public services hotline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silicon Valley and other capital ventures hubs around the world have already backed several startups that leverage, if not rely entirely on, bots. Benedict Evans, Partner at the Venture Capital Firm, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz (&#8216;</span><a href="http://www.a16z.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a16z</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeted &#8220;I genuinely can&#8217;t remember the last time a concept blew up as quickly as bots&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, I’ve been part of a business that, like Toby Shapshak, was ahead of the “bot” curve that’s now consuming the business and customer experience worlds. Expedia, Bosch, DHL, Unilever, Stella Artois, HomeAdvisor, The National Domestic Violence Hotline, Red Cross and many others use </span><a href="http://t.yesware.com/tt/40cc1fc6e25c0e6b6c473b6e5d7078c28afa0f2a/489eb37184cda59ba3c43d567cdd0d3e/ac7788ed6176abd000e4ebc066e9c752/l.gbtrck.com/1ab15380-e2b7-425a-9ad9-959cef88b9b1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OneReach</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create (and manage) self-service messaging bots and live communications with their customers. The most popular use-cases include live and automated customer support, proactive order status notifications or order updates, payments/purchasing and text or chat-enabled IVRs (now called chat-bots). Who’d have thought that a bot could reduce 40% of a major brand’s customer support costs, increase revenue by 30% or boost NPS scores?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toby Shapshak seems to have been the oracle that foretold one of the most prolific changes in how consumers and businesses communicate and do commerce. He suggested that bots are “effectively an intersection of the most basic and sophisticated communication. It&#8217;s remarkable that the very rich (in the developed world) and poor (in the developing world) have effectively ended up in the same place (both using bots)”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Years have past since his Ted Talk and we thought it would be valuable to see what Toby thinks of today’s climate and where things go from here. </span></p>
<h2><b>Our interview with Toby Shapshak</b></h2>
<p><b>Elias: </b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Messenger Bots are impacting the everyday life and habits of consumers &#8211; in commerce, purchasing, managing one’s time, getting news and so on. You’ve been watching the impact of messenger bots in Africa for sometime. With this in mind, what perspective would you offer to business leaders and experience-designers on the impact that messenger bots have on consumer habits &#8211; in commerce and purchasing or donations, customer support, managing one’s time, getting news and so on?</span></i></p>
<p><b>Toby:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Business leaders and UX designers should be aware of how chatbots can have an impact on consumer habits; both positively and negatively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the youth of the world, who have grown up using chat, it&#8217;s a logical extension to communicate through this channel, ask questions, even make purchases. Pew Research found that American teenagers were only using email to communicate with &#8220;authority figures&#8221; &#8211; adults, parents and teachers. Now chatting is so dominant that WhatsApp has over a 1 billion users and Facebook Messenger has some 800 million users and 50 million businesses. WeChat has some 800 million users, mostly in China, and has been using bots in a very sophisticated way for a lot longer. Wechat is the future of chatting mingled with commerce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The great thing about SMS &#8211; which is arguably the greatest communication medium the world has ever seen; and the most expensive &#8211; is that it works on every single cellphone, no matter how sophisticated. The other key thing is SMS has a 100% read rate &#8211; even the spam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this context, doing new things like search or shopping via messaging/chat seems obvious to a generation of youngsters that prefer chat to email or anything else. Chat is cheaper and it&#8217;s a paradigm that people understand. It also doesn&#8217;t have a learning curve, the way that conventional apps do. </span></p>
<p><b>Elias: </b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013 you commented that &#8220;while the rest of the world is updating statuses and playing games on smartphones, Africa is developing useful SMS-based solutions to everyday needs”. Is the current wave of messenger bots solving real problems or this just the new version of &#8220;updating statuses and playing games on smartphones”?</span></i></p>
<p><b>Toby: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, a lot of chatbots seem like a nice-to-have. Give them some maturity and we&#8217;ll see if they are a flash-in-the-pan hype or something that will be continuingly useful.</span></p>
<p><b>Elias: </b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the rest of the world catching up or is Africa still ahead and in what ways? What has the rest of the world yet to learn still from African innovation?</span></i></p>
<p><b>Toby: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa is forced to innovate the way it does because there are no other alternatives. it&#8217;s the purest form of innovation out of necessity. More people in Africa have access to a cellphone than to electricity. Because of this there are brilliant power solutions, including solar-power systems like M-Kopa. If you have a pressing problem, it&#8217;s the best incentive in the world to solve it. If you have electricity, what are you likely to do? Watch TV or YouTube. it&#8217;s sadly that simple.</span></p>
<p><b>Elias: </b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are your predictions for where messaging and bots go next, in Africa and elsewhere?</span></i></p>
<p><b>Toby: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sky really is the limit, isn&#8217;t it. Text-based services are revolutionary in Africa, offering everything from Google search via SMS to important health information via South Africa&#8217;s mHealth initiatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin Kelly, the founding executive editor of Wired magazine, said some very interesting things at SXSW this year about how artificial intelligence will become part of our lives. Right now, he says, “it&#8217;s like the early days of cloud computing, but it will ultimately be as sophisticated a service as cloud-based offerings are now”. He called it &#8220;intelligence as a services&#8221;. “Like electricity, which you now buy in what we now call an on-demand model”, Kelly says &#8220;you won’t have to make your AI, you will just purchase it. It will flow like electricity from the grid to wherever you want it. &#8221; He says: &#8220;Artificial intelligence will soon be a commodity&#8221;. AI services at low cost will spur the chatbot industry and make offerings increasingly sophisticated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also the network effect to consider. Part of the reason Google&#8217;s search algorithms are so fast &#8211; and can predict or suggest answers so quickly &#8211; is because of the volume of search queries it has already performed. This inventory of queries and searches mean there is a greater volume of info to reference. As the volume of chatbot data increases, they will also become more effective.</span></p>
<h2><b>Reflection &amp; Looking Forward</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reflecting on Toby Shapshak’s 2013 Ted Talk it’s evident that he saw something revolutionary emerging amidst the noise in the world of experience design, business and technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to the concept of hindsight being 20/20, until 2016 the business world largely ignored the opportunity to leverage the most ubiquitous communication channels in the world (text messaging and IP messaging) for customer support. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/edn-moments/4402146/1st-text-message-is-sent--December-3--1992"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first text message was sent in 1992</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by 2007 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">74% of all mobile phone users worldwide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used text messaging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It took the western business world roughly another 10 years to accept the notion that just maybe they should consider communicating with their customers over the single most prefered communication channel in the world &#8211; SMS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the last 6 years at </span><a href="http://www.onereach.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OneReach,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I’ve been lucky enough to see startups and huge international brands alike use our tools to easily create and iterate on fully reportable and integrated bots. It’s been 3 years since Toby Shapshak’s TED talk and it’s great to finally see so many companies designing for the channels consumers actually prefer (messaging). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we’re here, let’s not be foolish enough to think that leveraging chat bots to drive business impact is any easier because the interface is an ‘old’ technology. The businesses world learned that building any old mobile app really isn’t all that hard. Similar to mobile apps, the success of a today’s chat bots will not be defined by whether or not your company offers chatbots. Success will rest on whether or not your chatbot experiences achieve desired outcomes for your business while being meaningful to your customer.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy Friday! Here’s our picks for the best customer service, customer experience, bot and mobile articles of the week, in no particular order.</p>
<h2><span id="more-7440"></span></h2>
<h2><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/enriquedans/2016/07/13/right-now-artificial-intelligence-is-the-only-thing-that-matters-look-around-you/#6f20d34b2480">Right Now, Artificial Intelligence is the Only Thing That Matters</a>&#8211; <a href="http://@edans">by Enrique Dans</a></h2>
<p>Machine learning and artificial intelligence are the keys to almost every aspect of life in the very near future: every sector, every business. Read on to find out how to integrate artificial intelligence for smarter business communication.</p>
<h2><a href="http://digiday.com/brands/two-months-1-800-flowers-facebook-bot-working/">Two Months in: How the 1-800 Flowers Facebook Bot is Working Out</a>&#8211; <a href="http://@digiday">by Grace Caffyn</a></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">You&#8217;ve heard all the hype around bots, but just exactly how are bots doing? According to this article, most customers, mainly millennials prefer to interact with a robot rather than a human. Surprisingly, </span><span style="font-size: medium;">the people using this bot are attracting younger audience. </span></p>
<h2><a href="http://www.mycustomer.com/community/blogs/denispombriant/the-four-attributes-of-customer-loyalty-the-role-of-automation-in">The Four Attributes of Customer Loyalty</a> &#8211;<a href="http://@DenisPombriant">by Denis Prombriant </a></h2>
<p>This is the first of four articles, discussing a trait that makes up the best customer loyalty. The first major attribute- AUTOMATION. At OneReach we believe automation is key, whether for creating  bots or enabling logic based routing. Automation&#8217;s purpose is to trim down on labor and maximize the role of the resources companies invest.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/shephyken/2016/07/09/whats-hot-in-customer-service-and-whats-not/#1b3f5f66601a">What&#8217;s Hot in Customer Service&#8211;And What&#8217;s Not</a>&#8211;<a href="http://@Hyken">by Shep Hyken </a></h2>
<p>With the phone starting to take a back seat for communication regarding issues or questions, self-service is, and will, continue to grow in the future. As technology improves for automated assistants, customers are becoming more comfortable to not have to interact with an actual human being.</p>

<p>Customer service has evolved a lot in the past few decades. Support interactions used to be limited to just a phone call, but now customers can reach a company over email, social media and even text message. Self-service is an option to make customers’ lives easier, but it&#8217;s not a substitute for good customer service.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This guest post is written by Olga Grigorenko, a freelance writer for <a href="http://fueled.com">Fueled</a>.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can all remember the days when we memorized our friends’ numbers, carefully recorded new contacts in address books, and coquettishly wrote down our digits on party napkins. Telephones were lifelines and phone calls were indispensable. But then </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mobile</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> phones happened, and our means of communication changed drastically. Exchanging contact information became far more simplified and reaching anyone over the phone became significantly easier. Phone calls could now be made on the go &#8211; anywhere, anytime.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-7426"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1970, mobile phones were installed into cars and just three years later, Motorola produced the first handheld mobile phone. The network of wireless towers built to service these mobile phones was arranged in what was called a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cellular layout</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, due to its close resemblance to a biological cell. Mobile phones used on this cellular network were soon simply called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cellular phones</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">; while </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cellular</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mobile</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are not technically synonymous, they’ve become completely interchangeable in the common vernacular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, wireless phones have developed into devices more comparable to computers than telephones, a factor evident not only in their capabilities, but in our usage of them. Mobile phones are now used for taking pictures, sending emails, <a href="https://fueled.com/">using apps</a>, and listening to music. So when exactly did we stop using our mobile devices as phones and why is it that we still call them </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">phones?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact of the matter is that the ways in which we communicate with each other have changed, and our mobile phones have changed accordingly. Physical phone calls occur less often because they limit us to one task at a time, while texting allows us the freedom to simultaneously listen to music, draft a work email, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">also</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> post on Instagram. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, all of these advanced capabilities were added onto the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cell phone</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and not vice versa. This perhaps, is the only reason we still call our mobile devices cell phones, and it’s very likely that this may change in the future. There are many other phrases that have managed to outlive their literal meaning. We </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">type</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but not on typewriters; we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">rewind</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> things that weren’t unwound; we listen to internet </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">radio</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that doesn’t run on radio waves; we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CC</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Carbon Copy) people on emails when there’s no carbon paper on our desks. So the question arises: what exactly should we be calling these devices that we carelessly carry around in our pockets?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a few decades, what we now call </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">phones</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be able to execute amazing feats &#8211; like supporting photorealistic games, or substituting personalized med packs. As these devices and our use of them continue to evolve, so will our terminology for them. There is no doubt that the ways in which we communicate with each other will continue to change, but our essential human need for communication and contact will remain the same.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Push notifications are big business. Apple has sent over 7.4 trillion</span><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2013/06/11/14-eye-popping-apple-statistics-from.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">push notifications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since the launch of iCloud in 2011, and research has found 84% of millennials respond to</span><a href="http://www.dmnews.com/marketing-strategy/84-percent-of-millennials-act-on-push-notifications/article/448580/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">retailers’ push notifications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In fact, Facebook has even create an app specifically devoted to</span><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/04/media/facebook-news-notifications-app/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">notifications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the New York Times has an 11-person team dedicated to</span><a href="http://digiday.com/publishers/inside-new-york-times-new-push-notifications-team/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">push notifications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easy to see why people like push notifications. They’re controlled by the user (they can turn them or of), there’s a deep link to the application so you don’t have to go searching through it, and it’s not limited by characters like other messages. In addition, push notifications aren’t highly regulated (for better or worse) and don’t cost anything to receive them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while there’s nothing quite like the thrill of receiving a new notification, push notifications aren’t always the best way to engage with customers. In fact, some consumers are turning them off.</span></p>
<h2><span id="more-7365"></span><b>When Push Notifications Become Too Much  </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For all of push notifications’ popularity, these notifications can sometimes get too, well, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">pushy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Millennials noted they’re turned off by</span><a href="http://www.dmnews.com/marketing-strategy/84-percent-of-millennials-act-on-push-notifications/article/448580/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">notifications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that are too intrusive (34%), too often (25%) or poorly timed (11%). Organizations have also gotten called out for sending users</span><a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/02/06/prevent-app-getting-pushy-push-notifications/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">irrelevant updates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Y&#8217;all really think this deserves a push notification? <a href="https://t.co/4sSLNJ8xFW">pic.twitter.com/4sSLNJ8xFW</a></p>
<p>— Nick Morrow (@NRMorrow) <a href="https://twitter.com/NRMorrow/status/663882868846960640">November 10, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And push notification opt-in rates aren’t necessarily as good as they look. Android has a 78% opt-in rate compared to iOS’ 46%, but part of this is because Android users are</span><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150630005780/en/Kahuna-Mobile-Marketing-Index-90-App-Users"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">automatically opted-in</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150630005780/en/Kahuna-Mobile-Marketing-Index-90-App-Users"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Opt-in rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are also dramatically different across verticals, where they’re as high as 78% for travel and transportation, and as low as 35% for medical, health and fitness. If you’re developing an app in one of the lower-performing categories, you’re going to have a tough time engaging customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, when it comes to people actually interacting with these notifications, the chance they are is relatively low—</span><a href="http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/accengage-six-percent-of-users-respond-to-push-notifications-infographic/615791"><span style="font-weight: 400;">just six percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And interacting with the notification also takes a lot of effort: you have to click, go into the app, then perform the action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But let’s take a look at the app that’s sending the push notifications. It can cost a fortune to develop </span><a href="http://resources.kinvey.com/docs/State+of+Enterprise+Mobility+Survey+2014+-+Kinvey.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a mobile app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it’s only going to be accessible on smartphones, not feature phones. While a good portion of Americans own </span><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/chapter-one-a-portrait-of-smartphone-ownership/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">smartphones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (64%), you’re still missing out on over a third of cell phone users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, you have a choice on how to notify customers, and it’s not just limited to push notifications. You can do it all through the most-used app on a smartphone: text messaging. In fact, Pew Research has found that texting even trumps social media use as the most common daily smartphone activity. </span></p>

<h2><b>Text Messages vs Push Notifications</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While texts and push notifications are similar insofar as they’re controlled by the user (with text, it’s an opt-in/opt-out program) and that there’s a deep link to the application (assuming the app has been downloaded already), the similarities end there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s because the purpose of push notifications is to do one thing—notify. It doesn’t require any further action, for better and for worse. It’s a one-way communication channel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to make sure customers are getting (and interacting with) your message, there’s no better channel than text. Text has a</span><a href="http://mobilemarketingwatch.com/sms-marketing-wallops-email-with-98-open-rate-and-only-1-spam-43866/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">98% open rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a</span><a href="https://www.marketingtechblog.com/text-messaging/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">45% response rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, trumping push notifications’ read rate of just six percent. Text transforms one-way reminders into two-way notifications, like an appointment reminder that can be rescheduled via SMS, or a restaurant deal that asks the first 100 users to text back to redeem it. Text can also be used for number verification, two-factor authentication, and a variety of other use cases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike push notifications, text also doesn’t require an Internet connection to function or an app to be downloaded—in fact, it’s a great way to </span><a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/voice-text-can-increase-mobile-app-downloads/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drive app downloads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And instead of just staying automated, texts can also be routed to a live agent for further interaction if a customer really needs help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One company using text notifications to great effect is Snooze. They’re an extremely popular breakfast eatery that almost always has a wait time due to the sheer amount of customers that visits them. To get around this, Snooze asks patrons for their telephone number, then sends them a text when their table is ready. This way, users can enjoy the freedom of walking through the shopping center around Snooze without having to tote around a buzzer. The “table ready” notifications are delivered directly to their phone.</span></p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Text messaging and push notifications are both great ways to notify consumers, but only text messaging can turn a notification into a conversation. There is certainly a time and place for both, so keep your desired outcome in mind as you activate your notification strategy.</span></p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Many of today’s top businesses offer a mobile app, and all of them are looking for downloads in an increasingly prevalent mobile market. There were an estimated<a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/266488/forecast-of-mobile-app-downloads/"> 138 billion global app downloads</a> in 2014, and that number is set to double to 270 billion in 2017. With over half of American consumers downloading around<a href="http://www.flurry.com/blog/flurry-insights/app-install-addiction-shows-no-signs-stopping#.VPXvNfnF9TY"> four apps a month</a>, how can your business tap into the booming mobile app market and increase downloads?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Answer: promote downloads through text message and voice, the two most common activities done on a mobile device.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7213"></span>Even though landline call traffic<a href="http://www.telecompetitor.com/fcc-landline-voice-lines-decline-4-7-in-six-months-voip-growth-slows/"> is on the decline</a>, voice is still one of the most widely used and ubiquitous channels in the world. And according to Pew Research,<a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/09/19/cell-phone-activities-2013/"> 81% of Americans</a> use their cell phone to send or receive text messages, while 50% use it to download apps.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Companies that use text and voice to boost their mobile app strategy will not only see increased downloads, but increased customer engagement.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Adding text and voice to your mobile app strategy</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://info.dynatrace.com/rs/compuware/images/Mobile_App_Survey_Report.pdf">Over 85% of mobile device users</a> prefer mobile apps over mobile websites, largely because they’re more convenient, faster and easier to browse. In addition,<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/01/mobile-app-usage-increases-in-2014-as-mobile-web-surfing-declines/"> 86% of time spent on the mobile web</a> is spent on apps, compared just 14% for mobile web browsers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: 0pt none; float: center; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/eCQMUW60JMiWMprnyMlDGc7bKq56Kbe3ZiBCeeNV3LJNvat5e4sd6Eenl7YbkMaXSZ8_4CXFm4uA2yLg9yalMSt7FOFxEwBB4ekUfCueA_qGiM-7o7C1KABOlBAQ4ZqI74SY7vI" alt="" width="395" height="344" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">A true omnichannel communication strategy will leverage existing channels (e.g. phone calls) to drive adoption and usage of other channels. That means that customer data collected across channels should be used to deliver a personalized experience, no matter what channel the customer uses. Similarly, if a customer decides to switch between channels, the conversation and context should be maintained (<a href="http://blogs.aspect.com/2014/01/29/infographic-omni-channel-service-doesnt-measure-up-customers-are-tired-of-playing-games/">something over 90% of customers expect</a>).</p>
<p dir="ltr">An omnichannel solution can help you track whether or not a customer has downloaded a mobile app and adapt accordingly. <strong>For example, if a customer calls into your company, your IVR should know if the caller has downloaded the app.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">An omnichannel solution like OneReach can make an API call to your existing customer database to see if customers have created an account or downloaded an app. If they haven’t, create a separate branch within the IVR that encourages users to download the app. It’s as simple as letting a caller “press 1” to receive a text message with a link to download the app.</p>
<p dir="ltr">An omnichannel solution can also switch customers between channels based on which one best suits a specific task. During the call, offer to send a download link via text message by prompting the caller to press 1 (far easier than reciting the URL over voice). No matter what the customer is calling in for (mobile payment, rescheduling, etc.), your IVR flow should promote the idea that they can perform any of these activities within your mobile app (and subsequently provide a link to download it). Once customers have downloaded an app,  update the customer database programatically. If customers aren’t downloading the app, consider moving the CTA to another part of the voice or text flow.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Taking it further with texting</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Businesses aren’t just limited to dropping a link via SMS. Businesses should also consider offering the ability to receive a text from their website, like Hotwire does:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="border: 0pt none; float: center; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VcJuoU9xcEQblTPV0l-g2ZqIoc9zlNGTE_ppxqO-L2UACntMdBQTid_t7qUUSbRAhK0LiPXvNK6tC3l9IkLUqVi83qzMEp3jYoxB--uoHeB-6wHf4vpptWi_PxEqQzkdFNHkOm4" alt="" width="439" height="305" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Businesses can take it even further by changing the copy of the text message based on any number of things: seasonality, what they know about the user (based on the phone number entered), current marketing campaigns, etc.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The best part is that the marketing department can update the copy anytime without having to ask developers to change the API.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">However, it’s important to note that capturing a potential customer’s attention with a deal or incentive to encourage a download is only one piece of the puzzle. Maintaining a relationship past the app download and engaging customers is equally important. While it may not be fiscally feasible to offer provide discounts to app users every time they use an app, there are alternatives. To increase mobile app engagement, businesses can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track how users use their app</li>
<li>Establish loyalty programs and points systems</li>
<li>Personalize messages and push notifications</li>
<li>Invite users to leave a review in the app store</li>
<li>Create a sense of urgency by reminding users of deal deadlines (include a link within the notification directing them to the specific page within the app)</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h2>
<p dir="ltr">An app is only useful when downloaded. By using the existing communication channels that your customers are already using, you can increase the number of app downloads and offer an enhanced customer experience.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Having a “mobile strategy” goes beyond just having a mobile application and mobile friendly website. It means using all of the capabilities of today’s mobile phones and understanding the role that these devices play in the lives of your customers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">How much of a role? Not to get too personal,<a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/233230"> but more people would rather give up sex than give up their phone</a>. A study found that 26% of Americans said they couldn’t live without their smartphone, while only 20% of Americans said they couldn’t live without sex. The same study found that 44% of people sleep with their phone at night, and 67% check their phone even if it’s not ringing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7173"></span>With such a close connection to our mobile phones, it’s no surprise that we use them for anything and everything: checking bank accounts, ordering food, getting customer service help, etc. A lot of apps provide this service, but it isn’t always enough.<a href="http://onereachcontactcenter.com/high-demand-for-customer-service-via-text-message/"> According to a study</a> conducted by Harris Interactive and commissioned by OneReach, over 60% of consumers would prefer to use text for customer service, (and most are frustrated with today’s typical service channels like phone and email).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Customers don’t think in terms of channel when they’re trying to get support&#8211;they are looking for an experience that requires the least amount of effort. This means that downloading yet another app isn’t always an appealing option. Think about how much easier it would be to manage banking, shipments and dinner reservations over SMS, instead of downloading a different app for each separate need.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s not hard to see why consumers want to the ability to text a support line, given that <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/mobile-technology-fact-sheet/">SMS is the most used app on a mobile device</a>. However, it’s important to understand how using this channel can support a more broad mobile strategy. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using SMS to deliver a link to your mobile app can improve install rates.</strong> The average person checks their phone<a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.slicktext.com/blog/2014/02/text-message-marketing-the-new-kid-on-the-block-infographic/"> within five seconds</a> of receiving a text message. Sending your users a link to download the app means there’s a higher chance of them actually doing what you want them to do.</li>
<li><strong>Allowing customers to text your contact center can reduce costs and improve customer satisfaction.</strong> The average contact center phone call <a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=273">costs between $6-20</a>; in contrast, two-way text chat costs only $2-5, a price that can be reduced even more with automation. Additionally,<a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.cfigroup.com/downloads/CCSI_2012.pdf"> a study by CFI Group</a> showed that SMS had the highest satisfaction score of any channel.</li>
<li><strong>Using SMS for proactive notifications can reduce the amount of inbound call volume and improve customer satisfaction.</strong> For organizations like a doctor’s office, this technology is essential; instead of having 10 patients call to schedule their next appointment, a personalized, automated text could be sent out to schedule a future appointment.</li>
<li><strong>Using SMS to transition social interactions (particularly negative ones) to a more private channel is a great way to manage your reputation.</strong> It can be a business’ nightmare when a customer shares their complaints on social media for every to see. One alternative is to have the support agent tweet back a number that the customer could text, transitioning the conversation from public to private, decreasing the chance for public fallout.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Text is powerful on its own, but when it works with other channels, it’s unstoppable.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">In the business world, the ability to utilize and offer intelligent automation solutions is a crucial part of continued growth. In the contact center environment, introducing alternative channels like text and chat can lower costs while providing customers with a range of options. Over the past few years, mobile apps have become a prevalent fixture in innovative business technology, but using this type of platform can be <a href="https://fueled.com/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-develop-an-app/">expensive</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7136"></span>Although smartphone users have <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/13/smartphones-outsell-dumb-phones-globally/">surpassed</a> basic cell phone users, using text chat for business communication is the better choice. To date, the use of mobile apps in the U.S. and on a worldwide platform is <a href="http://mobithinking.com/mobile-marketing-tools/latest-mobile-stats/e#appusers">declining</a>, with SMS texting being the most-used activity. Here are a few reasons why:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Texting is more user-friendly.</strong> Mobile apps can go down, preventing the customer from accessing the information they need. With text-chat, you will get your message instantaneously without having to enter passwords or other information. You also give customers a reason to add your business to their phone, meaning you are now in your customer’s pocket.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>It saves money.</strong> The amount of money saved by using text-chat over mobile app development is staggering. Development and administration costs can include hiring a developer or two, deciding what the app should do, how it should look, structuring it for both the iOS and Android platforms, consistent checking for bugs, and the creation and administration of updates as needed to stay relevant. All of these costs are eliminated by the use of text chat. OneReach clients have been able to get text chat up and running in less than a week’s time.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Texting is more widespread.</strong> Over 81% of the U.S. adult population texts—that’s over 250 million people. Texts can be sent in HTML form or in standard SMS, which will automatically adapt to the phone’s user platform. This has become a popular way for big box stores to advertise coupons and upcoming sales. Can you imagine how much more powerful it would be allowing your customers to text you back?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>It remembers where you left off.</strong> With texting, you can pick up your conversation at the most recent point, while with mobile apps, you have to restart each time you open the app. Additionally, omni-channel support systems can be used that will automatically identify previous customers based on the phone number to personalize the customer experience.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Texting enhances interaction.</strong> By using a text messaging system, customers can ask in-depth questions and receive detailed information privately and discreetly. Text chat improves the customer experience by drawing on previous conversations to personalize each interaction with the customer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As technology continues to develop and enhance the “right-now” consumer mindset, employing tactics that will keep customers easily engaged and connected to the company is key. Text chat is simple, smart and cost-effective.</p>
