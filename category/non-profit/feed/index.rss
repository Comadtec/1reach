								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three weeks ago, a devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Nepal, killing 7,000 people and displacing millions. Homes were leveled, monuments were reduced to rubble, and a people were shaken.</p>
<p>In the hours that followed, aid organizations rushed into action, mobilizing medical personnel and rescue workers in response to the crisis. Organizations like Doctors Without Borders and global Red Cross societies organized search and rescue efforts, tended to the wounded and distributed supplies.</p>
<p>Then, a second earthquake hit.</p>
<p>Across the world, countries have put forth millions of dollars in aid, <a href="http://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/may-5-2015-usaid-announces-11-million-additional-assistance-nepal-earthquake"> with the U.S. alone pledging $26 million</a>. On a smaller scale, global citizens have made donations of their own, whether online, over the phone or through text messaging. But in the wake of a disaster, it’s important not only to only to have donations set up—it’s important to have communications as well.</p>
<h1><span id="more-7233"></span>How to communicate in a disaster</h1>
<p><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/text-response.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1542 size-medium" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/text-response-300x300.png" alt="text response" width="300" height="300" /></a>In the aftermath of a disaster, people are trying to find loved ones, shelter, and food and water. In the United States, FEMA sends out<a href="https://www.fema.gov/frequently-asked-questions-wireless-emergency-alerts"> Wireless Emergency Alerts</a> when disasters strike. These messages detail actions residents in afflicted areas should take, as well as the agency sending the message. Residents can also<a href="http://www.fema.gov/text-messages"> text the short code 43362 (4FEMA)</a> with the keyword SHELTER and their zip code to find shelter near them.</p>
<p>You might be asking why texting and not, say, a mobile app. One reason is that a lot more people use feature phones than smartphones in developing nations. Take the United States and Nepal, for instance. Mobile phone penetration is about<a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/222307/forecast-of-mobile-phone-penetration-in-the-us/"> 80% in the United States</a>, with about<a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/#smartphones"> 64% penetration for smartphones</a>. In contrast, mobile phone penetration is at<a href="http://www.nta.gov.np/en/2012-06-01-11-33-01/mis-archives/mis-reports/nta-mis-85/download"> 79% in Nepal</a>, but is only at<a href="http://www.nepalitelecom.com/2015/03/top-ten-phone-makers-market-in-nepal.html"> about 20% for smartphones</a>.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that mobile apps and the Internet aren’t valuable post-crisis, but in Nepal,<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2915012/nepal-communications-hit-by-power-outage-lastmile-issues.html"> when links aren’t going through</a> and the Internet is slow, text might be the only option. Case in point: after the earthquake,<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/04/27/how-google-and-facebook-are-finding-victims-of-the-nepal-earthquake/"> Google deployed its Person Finder tool</a>, where global citizens could search for a missing person with SMS (shown here with the US search phone number).</p>
<p><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/text-response2.png"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-1543 alignright" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/text-response2-300x300.png" alt="text response2" width="300" height="300" /></a>Google had experience from past disasters like the Boston bombing and the earthquake/nuclear disaster at Fukushima. Similarly, the U.S. government has also been more prepared with disaster communications. After Hurricane Katrina,<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2506949/mobile-wireless/communication-key-to-post-disaster-survival.html"> major carriers mobilized portable cell towers</a> and made necessary repairs. In addition, <a href="http://www.disasterready.org/blog/humanitarian-aid-workers-increasingly-use-smartphones-online-learning">today’s relief workers</a> do have smartphones, which become tools to make things happen when communication is at its peak.</p>
<p>So what’s the most effective way to communicate in a disaster? According to the FCC, many times<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/emergency-communications-tips"> text messages will go through</a> when calls won’t,<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/31/uk-usa-weather-storms-idUSLNE84U01D20120531"> a sentiment FEMA echoes</a>. After the Boston bombing,<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3008458/tech-forecast/why-your-phone-doesnt-work-during-disasters-and-how-fix-it"> carriers urged customers to use texting</a> because they take up less bandwidth than voice. Text is not only a highly used channel&#8211;it’s also the only one that might get through.</p>
<h1>Preparing for the worst</h1>
<p>Google and American Red Cross are big organizations, so they’re able to rapidly deploy preexisting communication solutions. However, not all organizations have a communication solution in place, and they need to get one up and running quickly. And sometimes the magnitude of the disaster might wipe out the wireless network or cell towers.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s important to have a solution in place beforehand, if possible. Solutions like OneReach can be deployed in under an hour, and in the midst of a disaster, every second counts. Whatever platform you do use, make sure you have the right kind of number. Short codes can send more messages per minute than <a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=534">long codes</a>, but they typically take three months to provision, so plan ahead.</p>
<p>The next step is activating the flow before the disaster hits. This way, you can get people the answers they need even if your Internet connection goes down, because the phone number is stored in the cloud. If communications are restored after a disaster, you can then create additional outbound flows for people to engage with. One best practice is to get people to opt-in to updates and disaster notifications beforehand, instead of having to rely on inbound numbers that might get overwhelmed (or maybe not even seen at all).</p>
<p>But it’s not enough to get your message out—it’s important for people to read it, especially after a disaster. Text has a 98% open rate, so if an organization needs to get an important message out, there’s no better channel to use for maximum exposure. However, sometimes people want more information than an outbound alert provides, and sometimes the network bandwidth is overwhelmed. That’s why it’s so essential to create two-way text communication flows, to get people the answers they need as soon as possible.</p>
<p>However, text messaging won’t always be enough, as some citizens will want to call. You may not be able to answer everything, which is where automation comes in. If people contact you with the same question, you can create automated flows so people can get the answers they need via text while leaving space for more pressing calls. Questions about shelter, food and water, people&#8211;all of those can be managed through an automated voice or text flow that directs people to different questions based on their input.</p>
<p>If residents do need more specific information, they can also talk to an agent over text chat. The important part is that people are able to get their questions answered.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In the wake of a disaster, information can be as vital as food and water. By enabling a text solution before, during and after disaster strikes, organizations can get people the information they need on a reliable channel. And after your world gets shaken, having something you can count on is everything.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Custom SMS and voice solutions are incredibly powerful in humanitarian and natural disaster relief efforts. In the past, organizations have used texting to <a href="http://www.who.int/features/2014/senegal-ebola-sms/en/">send notifications</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/16/ebola-text-messaging-combat-outbreak">deliver surveys</a> and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/12/tech/mobile/charity-donations-text-messages/">solicit donations</a> (<a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=646">see our post on non-profits and SMS for more use cases</a>). But it’s really been over the past few months that texting has started to show its worth as a more sophisticated and even interactive large-scale communication solution.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7196"></span>When the Ebola virus started to spread through West Africa, afflicted nations partnered with non-profits to create large-scale text campaigns:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The Ministry of Health in Senegal and the World Health Organization (WHO) <a href="http://www.who.int/features/2014/senegal-ebola-sms/en/">adapted a text platform</a> called mDiabetes to send out Ebola health tips instead of diabetes health tips.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The World Food Programme (WFP) <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/oct/16/ebola-text-messaging-combat-outbreak">sent text surveys to monitor food security</a> in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The government of Sierra Leone partnered with a local phone provider and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2014/10/27/357647182/the-red-cross-is-using-text-messaging-to-take-down-ebola"> to send out health reminders to citizens over text</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">There are three notable features of these all these use cases, the first being <strong>interactivity</strong>. The platform used in Sierra Leone lets citizens text in questions and receive automated responses about treatment options and health tips, all at no cost. During regional or national emergencies in the United States,<a href="https://www.fema.gov/wireless-emergency-alerts"> citizens receive text-like Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs)</a> advising them to take specific actions. However, they don’t have the ability to text back, which can be frustrating if someone wants or needs to get more basic information quickly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The second feature is the <strong>ubiquity of texting</strong>. In African countries like Sierra Leone, most citizens don’t have access to mobile data but can send and receive SMS. Texting is one of the most effective ways to mass communicate with citizens anywhere in the world since it’s so widespread—over 69% of Sierra Leoneans have a cell connection. The stats in the U.S. aren’t much different:<a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/09/19/cell-phone-activities-2013/"> over 80% of Americans use texting</a>, and over 90% own a cell phone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The third feature of the Sierra Leone use case is <strong>government support</strong>. The Sierra Leonean government is able to mass communicate with its citizens, much like the U.S. government does with wireless alerts. However, non-governmental organizations in the U.S. that want to mass communicate via text need to comply with Mobile Marketing Associations guidelines. They give citizens<a href="http://www.mmaglobal.com/files/uploads/Consumer-Best-Practices.pdf"> the chance to opt-in to receive messages</a>—in other words, they can’t text them out of the blue without their consent. For companies using short codes (5-6 digit numbers), this is a must; for companies using long codes (10-digit numbers), this isn’t required but is highly recommended.</p>
<p>There’s a lot that’s technically possible with texting—your use-cases, the tools and resources you have available will ultimately determine how far you can take it. But the extent to which resources is a factor is decreasing dramatically. For example, OneReach makes it easy and fast to create custom SMS solutions without the often expensive costs of programming resources.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The question isn’t what can text messaging do for your organization, it’s what can’t text messaging do for your organization?</p>
<p dir="ltr">From setting up a simple automated survey to initiating more complex fundraising campaigns, SMS offers an abundance of possibilities. The best part, especially for organizations with limited financial and technology resources, is that it’s easy, far-reaching and inexpensive.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7157"></span><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/mobile-technology-fact-sheet/">Over 90% of American adults</a> have cell phones, and 81% use text messaging. (Plus you don’t have to have a smartphone to text!) With systems like OneReach, even those of us who can’t write code can still create custom voice and text flows. Even better, it costs under two cents to send and receive a text message.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Short Codes Can Come at a Cost</h2>
<p dir="ltr">A lot of campaigns contact mobile users with a short code, a five to six digit phone number used to reach large groups of people. Unfortunately, short codes can cost up to $10,000 just to set up. While that number might be feasible for groups like The Red Cross, it’s a figure that’s out of reach for most non-profits. Short codes are also under strict regulation by the government to keep companies from spamming people with notifications.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Luckily, business are no longer limited to short codes. Companies like Twilio text-enable traditional 10-digit phone numbers, or “long codes.” One of the best parts about long codes is that they only cost $1-2 to set up, so they’re an affordable option for any organization.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Short codes also have pretty limited functionality; users can only perform one of a few predetermined actions. With OneReach, organizations can build more complicated text flows, creating different action paths based on what the users chooses to do. You can build personalized experiences almost as fast as you can think of them.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Texting for Non-Profits</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Various non-profits have used texting for regularly scheduled tips and campaign donations, but that’s not all they’ve done. Check out some of the examples below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dosomething.org</strong>—<a href="dosomething.org">This organization</a> has tackled causes ranging from fighting cancer to diversity in the media, but one of their most well-known campaigns was “<a style="font-style: normal;" href="https://www.dosomething.org/bullytext2012">The Bully Text</a>.” Targeted at high school students, this 2012 campaign was set during an imaginary first day of school. Students who opted-in with their name and phone number received a text with a certain situation and two ways to respond. Depending on what option they chose, the rest of the texts they put them in situations as the bully, the bullied, or someone who stood up for them.</li>
<li><strong>Text4baby</strong>—In 2010, the National Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Coalition launched<a style="font-style: normal;" href="https://www.text4baby.org/"> Text4baby</a>, a free SMS service that provides pregnant women with educational tips about maternal and child health. The texts are sent during and after pregnancy and cover a variety of topics like prenatal care and nutrition; major medical associations and other non-profits review the texts for accuracy. A George Washington University study found that Text4baby participants<a style="font-style: normal;" href="https://www.text4baby.org/index.php/about/faq#program"> were three times as likely to feel</a> they were prepared to be new mothers.</li>
<li><strong>ASPCA</strong>—The<a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.aspca.org/"> American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals</a> (ASPCA) has used SMS to inform pet owners and increase fundraising since 2008. Pet owners can opt-in to the service by sending the word CAT or DOG to 27222 and receive regular tips on pet care. A call-to-action at the bottom of each text asks users to give $5 to animals in need; all users have to do is text the word GIVE to donate.<a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.mobilemarketer.com/cms/news/messaging/2759.html"> About five percent of SMS subscribers</a> donate to the organization, raising thousands of additional dollars for animals each year.</li>
<li><strong>The Red Cross</strong>—Back in early 2010,<a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/12/tech/mobile/charity-donations-text-messages/"> a massive earthquake rocked Haiti</a>, killing over 100,000 people and displacing millions.<a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.redcross.org/"> The Red Cross</a> immediately began collecting donations over SMS, asking Americans to donate $10 by texting Haiti to 90999 (each donor had the amount added to their phone bill). With promotion from the federal government and national media, the Red Cross and other organizations raised over $43 million with SMS.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Keep in mind these are all pretty big organizations with a lot of resources at their disposal. Most non-profits can’t afford to buy a short code, or hire a developer to create a voice and text system.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, companies like Twilio and OneReach have programs to make things more affordable and accessible. OneReach helps you assemble a sophisticated system easily without knowing a thing about coding. Plus, the application is cloud-based, meaning you can quickly build, test, deploy and manage your applications from a browser.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If your non-profit had endless resources to create intelligent voice and SMS applications, would you turn to the most affordable system, or the most advanced system?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Why not both?</p>
