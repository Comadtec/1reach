								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The ability to buy a car over texting is coming to a pocket near you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You heard that right: you can now buy a car with a few clicks of a virtual button. The U.S. Census Bureau recently found that<a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20141119/RETAIL07/141119794/more-car-buyers-are-ok-with-dealer-texting-survey-says"> American consumers are open to using text</a> to sell vehicles and communicate post-purchase.</p>
<p dir="ltr">More promising news: consumers are more interested in using text purchasing than they were last year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So then, why is it so hard to open our minds to the idea of digital commerce? It’s not like we’ve already done it before…</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oh wait, we have.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr"><span id="more-7183"></span>The Internet mind shift</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Twenty years ago, you would have thought it was crazy to buy something over the Internet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now, you can’t imagine life without it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hard as it is to believe, people didn’t have high hopes for the internet back when it was introduced. Critics derided the Internet as a passing thing, a flash in the pan that would soon fizzle out. Newsweek writer Clifford Stoll<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/clifford-stoll-why-web-wont-be-nirvana-185306"> delivered this infamous Internet takedown</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“The truth in no online database will replace your daily newspaper, no CD-ROM can take the place of a competent teacher and no computer network will change the way government works.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Similarly, the thought of buying things over the Internet was equally absurd. Other writers were mystified by the once out-there notion of e-commerce, or as they described it,<a href="http://time.com/money/3108995/online-shopping-history-anniversary/"> “a tele-magical shopping experience.”</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Much to the chagrin of Stoll and others, all of this came to pass. Today, you can buy anything from<a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Ferrari-430-2dr-Coupe-Berlinetta-2007-f-430-berlinetta-coupe-scuderia-shields-daytona-carbon-fiber-/181590249268?forcerrptr=true&amp;hash=item2a479f4f34&amp;item=181590249268&amp;pt=US_Cars_Trucks"> Ferraris</a> to<a href="http://www.castlesandmanorhouses.com/chateauxforsale.htm"> castles</a> to<a href="http://www.privateislandsonline.com/"> private islands</a> with the click of a button (and some credit card information). Most Americans make much smaller purchases, spending the bulk of their money on<a href="http://www.marketingprofs.com/charts/2013/12195/online-shopping-trends-most-popular-categories-top-purchase-drivers"> consumer electronics, books and clothing/apparel</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition,<a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/272391/us-retail-e-commerce-sales-forecast/"> Americans spent over $260 billion</a> in online transactions last year, and we’re on track to spend an additional $40 billion this year. Pretty incredible numbers for pundits who once pointed out that their “local mall does more business in an afternoon than the entire Internet handles in a month.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s because sites like Amazon can do business anywhere, anytime, and it turns out texting can too.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But just like the Internet, it’s taken a little while to get there.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">From the desk to the device</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Most Americans were just as ambivalent about text messaging as they were about the internet.<a href="http://www.ericsson.com/news/121130-twenty-years-of-short-message-service_244159017_c"> Consumers were much more enamored with mobile voice</a> than they were with mobile messaging.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, when mobile phone providers started offering prepaid plans and the ability to communicate across networks, texting took off with the younger generation.<a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/09/19/cell-phone-activities-2013/"> Needless to say, it hasn’t really slowed down since</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Texting has evolved a lot from its early days. In addition to letting friends know you’re lol-ing at their latest joke, you can use texting to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a style="font-style: normal;" href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/14663-recovering-a-lost-or-forgotten-password">Reset passwords</a></li>
<li><a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.ups.com/content/us/en/resources/track/sms_track.html">Track an item’s delivery status</a></li>
<li><a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/jul/19/philippines-sms-typhoon-disaster-response">Alert citizens about disasters</a></li>
<li><a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://mashable.com/2012/10/02/mobile-election-2012/">Announce your presidential running mate to supporters</a></li>
<li><a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://americanidolnet.com/how-to-vote-american-idol-2014/">Vote for your favorite singer</a></li>
<li><a style="font-style: normal;" href="https://www.text4baby.org/">Receive health tips during pregnancy</a></li>
<li><a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/12/tech/mobile/charity-donations-text-messages/">Donate money to causes you care about</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">That’s just a start. Where texting is really starting to make strides is in mobile commerce. People are doing everything from buying cars to<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3010237/bottom-line/texting-is-the-new-email-does-your-company-do-it-right"> closing business deals over texting</a>. In fact, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-03-06/what-africa-can-teach-us-about-the-future-of-banking">African countries have been using SMS</a> for banking for nearly a decade. The precedent for mobile commerce already exists, and if it’s anything like e-commerce, this kind of behavior is only going to increase.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Who’s to say we won’t be buying islands next?</p>
