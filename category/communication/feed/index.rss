				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July of 2013 Toby Shapshak, the South African speaker, strategist and editor of Stuff Magazine, did a TED talk called </span><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/toby_shapshak_you_don_t_need_an_app_for_that?language=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You Don’t Need An App For That</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Business leaders, innovators and experience designers would soon realize how profound this TED talk was to the rest of the world. Shapshak’s astute observations and message to the rest of the world was years ahead of a revolution that Forbes would call </span><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2016/02/23/chat-bots-facebook-telegram-wechat/#5c9ad9142633"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“the new way we’ll be interacting with computers.”</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toby’s 2013 Ted talk touted that “while the rest of the world is updating statuses and playing games on smartphones, Africa is developing useful SMS-based solutions to everyday needs”. Since 2013 his TED talk has been viewed 1,438,046 times as of July 19, 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward a couple of years and we see more apps than anyone knows what to do with, as well as a notable decrease in</span><a href="http://onereach.com/blog/infographic-mobile-apps-vs-text-messaging/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> usage and app-downloads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This has businesses confused and frustrated. Meanwhile, around the world, messaging (SMS and the ever-encroaching uptake of IP messaging &#8211; Facebook Messenger, Spark, Slack, Kik, SnapChat, etc) is by far the most used function or app on mobile phones &#8211; smart phone or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2016 brought a wave of new businesses and products that fall into the category of </span><a href="http://onereach.com/blog/why-your-business-needs-a-bot/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; chat bots, messaging-bots, </span><a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/humans-ai-and-the-user-interface-of-the-future"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conversational-bots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “invisible apps” or &#8220;conversational commerce”. Messaging-bots are popping up for everything, increasingly displacing mobile-apps. New bots are being brought to life daily by startups and household brands alike. Whether the experiences are where they need to be or not, bots existing today which allow you to order a </span><a href="http://onereach.com/blog/i-tried-ordering-dominos-over-text-message-and-it-was-a-total-disaster/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pizza</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, make a payment, read the </span><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/04/media/new-york-times-text-message/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, be reminded of an appointment or even make an appointment. Even </span><a href="http://onereach.com/blog/cities-offer-text-311/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">city and county municipalities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are seeing the value, for example, Washington DC uses a </span><a href="https://onereach.com/bots/#dc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bot for their 311</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">-public services hotline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silicon Valley and other capital ventures hubs around the world have already backed several startups that leverage, if not rely entirely on, bots. Benedict Evans, Partner at the Venture Capital Firm, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz (&#8216;</span><a href="http://www.a16z.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a16z</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeted &#8220;I genuinely can&#8217;t remember the last time a concept blew up as quickly as bots&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, I’ve been part of a business that, like Toby Shapshak, was ahead of the “bot” curve that’s now consuming the business and customer experience worlds. Expedia, Bosch, DHL, Unilever, Stella Artois, HomeAdvisor, The National Domestic Violence Hotline, Red Cross and many others use </span><a href="http://t.yesware.com/tt/40cc1fc6e25c0e6b6c473b6e5d7078c28afa0f2a/489eb37184cda59ba3c43d567cdd0d3e/ac7788ed6176abd000e4ebc066e9c752/l.gbtrck.com/1ab15380-e2b7-425a-9ad9-959cef88b9b1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OneReach</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create (and manage) self-service messaging bots and live communications with their customers. The most popular use-cases include live and automated customer support, proactive order status notifications or order updates, payments/purchasing and text or chat-enabled IVRs (now called chat-bots). Who’d have thought that a bot could reduce 40% of a major brand’s customer support costs, increase revenue by 30% or boost NPS scores?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toby Shapshak seems to have been the oracle that foretold one of the most prolific changes in how consumers and businesses communicate and do commerce. He suggested that bots are “effectively an intersection of the most basic and sophisticated communication. It&#8217;s remarkable that the very rich (in the developed world) and poor (in the developing world) have effectively ended up in the same place (both using bots)”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Years have past since his Ted Talk and we thought it would be valuable to see what Toby thinks of today’s climate and where things go from here. </span></p>
<h2><b>Our interview with Toby Shapshak</b></h2>
<p><b>Elias: </b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Messenger Bots are impacting the everyday life and habits of consumers &#8211; in commerce, purchasing, managing one’s time, getting news and so on. You’ve been watching the impact of messenger bots in Africa for sometime. With this in mind, what perspective would you offer to business leaders and experience-designers on the impact that messenger bots have on consumer habits &#8211; in commerce and purchasing or donations, customer support, managing one’s time, getting news and so on?</span></i></p>
<p><b>Toby:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Business leaders and UX designers should be aware of how chatbots can have an impact on consumer habits; both positively and negatively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the youth of the world, who have grown up using chat, it&#8217;s a logical extension to communicate through this channel, ask questions, even make purchases. Pew Research found that American teenagers were only using email to communicate with &#8220;authority figures&#8221; &#8211; adults, parents and teachers. Now chatting is so dominant that WhatsApp has over a 1 billion users and Facebook Messenger has some 800 million users and 50 million businesses. WeChat has some 800 million users, mostly in China, and has been using bots in a very sophisticated way for a lot longer. Wechat is the future of chatting mingled with commerce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The great thing about SMS &#8211; which is arguably the greatest communication medium the world has ever seen; and the most expensive &#8211; is that it works on every single cellphone, no matter how sophisticated. The other key thing is SMS has a 100% read rate &#8211; even the spam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this context, doing new things like search or shopping via messaging/chat seems obvious to a generation of youngsters that prefer chat to email or anything else. Chat is cheaper and it&#8217;s a paradigm that people understand. It also doesn&#8217;t have a learning curve, the way that conventional apps do. </span></p>
<p><b>Elias: </b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013 you commented that &#8220;while the rest of the world is updating statuses and playing games on smartphones, Africa is developing useful SMS-based solutions to everyday needs”. Is the current wave of messenger bots solving real problems or this just the new version of &#8220;updating statuses and playing games on smartphones”?</span></i></p>
<p><b>Toby: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, a lot of chatbots seem like a nice-to-have. Give them some maturity and we&#8217;ll see if they are a flash-in-the-pan hype or something that will be continuingly useful.</span></p>
<p><b>Elias: </b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the rest of the world catching up or is Africa still ahead and in what ways? What has the rest of the world yet to learn still from African innovation?</span></i></p>
<p><b>Toby: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa is forced to innovate the way it does because there are no other alternatives. it&#8217;s the purest form of innovation out of necessity. More people in Africa have access to a cellphone than to electricity. Because of this there are brilliant power solutions, including solar-power systems like M-Kopa. If you have a pressing problem, it&#8217;s the best incentive in the world to solve it. If you have electricity, what are you likely to do? Watch TV or YouTube. it&#8217;s sadly that simple.</span></p>
<p><b>Elias: </b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are your predictions for where messaging and bots go next, in Africa and elsewhere?</span></i></p>
<p><b>Toby: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sky really is the limit, isn&#8217;t it. Text-based services are revolutionary in Africa, offering everything from Google search via SMS to important health information via South Africa&#8217;s mHealth initiatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin Kelly, the founding executive editor of Wired magazine, said some very interesting things at SXSW this year about how artificial intelligence will become part of our lives. Right now, he says, “it&#8217;s like the early days of cloud computing, but it will ultimately be as sophisticated a service as cloud-based offerings are now”. He called it &#8220;intelligence as a services&#8221;. “Like electricity, which you now buy in what we now call an on-demand model”, Kelly says &#8220;you won’t have to make your AI, you will just purchase it. It will flow like electricity from the grid to wherever you want it. &#8221; He says: &#8220;Artificial intelligence will soon be a commodity&#8221;. AI services at low cost will spur the chatbot industry and make offerings increasingly sophisticated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also the network effect to consider. Part of the reason Google&#8217;s search algorithms are so fast &#8211; and can predict or suggest answers so quickly &#8211; is because of the volume of search queries it has already performed. This inventory of queries and searches mean there is a greater volume of info to reference. As the volume of chatbot data increases, they will also become more effective.</span></p>
<h2><b>Reflection &amp; Looking Forward</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reflecting on Toby Shapshak’s 2013 Ted Talk it’s evident that he saw something revolutionary emerging amidst the noise in the world of experience design, business and technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to the concept of hindsight being 20/20, until 2016 the business world largely ignored the opportunity to leverage the most ubiquitous communication channels in the world (text messaging and IP messaging) for customer support. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/edn-moments/4402146/1st-text-message-is-sent--December-3--1992"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first text message was sent in 1992</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by 2007 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">74% of all mobile phone users worldwide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used text messaging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It took the western business world roughly another 10 years to accept the notion that just maybe they should consider communicating with their customers over the single most prefered communication channel in the world &#8211; SMS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the last 6 years at </span><a href="http://www.onereach.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OneReach,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I’ve been lucky enough to see startups and huge international brands alike use our tools to easily create and iterate on fully reportable and integrated bots. It’s been 3 years since Toby Shapshak’s TED talk and it’s great to finally see so many companies designing for the channels consumers actually prefer (messaging). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we’re here, let’s not be foolish enough to think that leveraging chat bots to drive business impact is any easier because the interface is an ‘old’ technology. The businesses world learned that building any old mobile app really isn’t all that hard. Similar to mobile apps, the success of a today’s chat bots will not be defined by whether or not your company offers chatbots. Success will rest on whether or not your chatbot experiences achieve desired outcomes for your business while being meaningful to your customer.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy Friday! Here’s our picks for the best customer service, customer experience, bot and mobile articles of the week, in no particular order.</p>
<h2><span id="more-7438"></span></h2>
<h2><span style="font-size: x-large;"><a href="http://customerthink.com/customer-centricity-is-more-than-promotional-hype/">Customer-Centricity is more than Promotional Hype</a> &#8211; by Mitchell Goozé</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">How do companies drive emotional engagement and guarantee they are fully committed to the needs of the customer? According to this article, centricity is key. Providing better customer service will ultimately end up in more profit, which is almost always the end goal for companies. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: x-large;"><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ibm/2016/06/20/how-to-architect-a-cognitive-future-for-business/#305197e0b173">How to Architect a Cognitive Future for Business </a> &#8211; by <a href="http://@TomRosamilia">Tom Rosamilia</a></span></h2>
<p>Many businesses are looking at the wide-spread possibilities of artificial intelligence to redefine their industries, businesses and customers. Business leaders are embracing artificial intelligence because consumers are using cognitive applications through phones and in their cars, creating better customer engagement.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: x-large;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/21/the-hidden-risks-of-the-bot-explosion/">The Hidden Risks of the Bot Explosion</a>&#8211; by <a href="http://@JenniferLSnell">Jennifer Snell</a> </span></h2>
<p>Whenever something new is introduced people are naturally skeptical about jumping into it. Building trust between humans and machines is very important and, like any relationship, takes time. People will only trust their bots if they trust the makers of their bots. At OneReach we want to make sure customers trust that we’re acting responsibly behind the curtain, and that we value the significance of their customer experience.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: x-large;"><a href="http://customerthink.com/you-machines-and-the-future-of-customer-service/">You, Machines, and the Future of Customer Service</a>&#8211; by <a href="http://@jtwatkin">Jeremy Watkin </a></span></h2>
<p>The newest technologies have an amazing capacity to make customer service more effective. Knowing that 40% of customers prefer to handle issues on their own, technology can reduce the effort put forth in order to get their issues resolved.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s an exciting time to be involved the customer service and communications space. There are more ways to interact with a brand than ever before (email, Twitter, even Snapchat), but one of the most new and exciting advancements is chatbots.</p>
<p><span id="more-7420"></span>In a recent article, The Guardian described chatbots as:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Chat bots are computer programs that mimic conversation with people using artificial intelligence. They can transform the way you interact with the internet from a series of self-initiated tasks to a quasi-conversation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In the customer service space, chatbots are using the growing power of artificial intelligence to allow customers to interact with a brand as they would with a customer service representative. However, there are some marked benefits to managing conversations with chatbots. Read on to find out why.</p>
<h2><strong>Chatbots are where the market is trending. </strong></h2>
<p>Last year, Uber’s director of experience Chris Messina wrote a post hailing the rise of something he called <a href="https://medium.com/chris-messina/2016-will-be-the-year-of-conversational-commerce-1586e85e3991#.jzhm93htd">conversational commerce</a>. He described it as:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Utilizing chat, messaging, or other natural language interfaces (i.e. voice) to interact with people, brands, or services and bots that heretofore have had no real place in the bidirectional, asynchronous messaging context.”</p></blockquote>
<p>His vision of conversational commerce has come to fruition this year with the exciting and not unrelated rise of bots. Messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger and Kik recently doubled down on chatbots, rolling out their own bot stores where developers can go in and code their own conversational chatbots.</p>
<p>While initial reaction to the chatbots has been somewhat lukewarm (their ability to handle natural language leaves something to be desired), we have to remember we’re just at the beginning of a very exciting evolution of B2C communications. In fact, Gartner made a prediction a few years back that by 2020, <a href="http://mktimages.gartner.com/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_92DB197B681D1A1003F701CB30B626FF3B111B00/filename/brochure_crm_2011.pdf">85% of customer interactions</a> would be managed without a human. The rise of chatbots dovetails nicely into this prediction.</p>
<h2><strong>Customers are open to the idea of chatbots.</strong></h2>
<p>While there’s still something to be said for a human touch in customer service, research has shown that 40% of <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/stevenvanbelleghem/the-self-serving-economy">customers prefer self-service</a>. In addition, Zendesk found that <a href="http://cdn.zendesk.com/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf">over 50% of customers</a> think it’s important that they can solve their problems themselves without having to rely on customer service agents.</p>
<p>Customers are also interested in interacting with your business over messaging (and already are). <a href="https://onereach.com/resources/high-demand-for-text-message-2014-report">A study</a> conducted by Harris Poll and commissioned by OneReach found that 64% of customers would rather text than call your business, and insights released during the <a href="http://www.edelman.com/83621/2016/04/15/facebook-messenger-for-business-brands-chatbots/">recent F8 Conference</a> showed that more than one billion messages are sent to businesses each month.</p>
<p>Combine the two approaches (self-service and texting/messaging) and you arrive at chatbots. Chatbots leverage a channel that customers are already using (texting/messaging) and blend it with their desire for a self-service experience.</p>
<h2><strong>Chatbots are cheaper and faster than live agents.</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve talked before about how much cheaper an automated interaction is compared to a live agent interaction (25 cents vs. $6-20). But in addition to being cheaper than live agents, chatbots are also an efficient way to deliver customer service—customers can type in their question and get a response back almost immediately based on pre-programmed logic.</p>
<p>For instance, I recently tried out Spring, one of the first Facebook Messenger bots to go public. It asked me if I wanted women’s or men’s items, then asked what kind of clothing I was looking for, all in rapid succession. Soon I was scrolling through results quickly and easily.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-2601 size-medium" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chatbots2-250x300.png" alt="chatbots2" width="250" height="300" /></p>
<p>Just like with Spring, most people will and are using chatbots for simple requests (getting a ride via Uber, ordering flowers, etc.), but sometimes customers may have more complex queries than the bot can understand. Going back to the Spring example, I found a cardigan I liked (it’s still kind of chilly in Denver, okay?) but wanted to know if they had it in a different color. When I asked the chatbot if they had it in white, the bot kindly told me they’d get back to me soon with an answer.<br />
<img class="wp-image-2600 size-medium aligncenter" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chatbots-250x300.png" alt="chatbots" width="250" height="300" /></p>
<p>By pivoting to a conversation with a live agent from within the bot conversation, you can ensure that every customer has a great experience.</p>
<h2><strong>Chatbots can incorporate visual media.</strong></h2>
<p>Humans are very visual creatures—in fact, <a href="http://info.shiftelearning.com/blog/bid/350326/Studies-Confirm-the-Power-of-Visuals-in-eLearning">we process images 60,000 times faster</a> than we do text. Images are a quick and easy way to communicate information, so that’s why it’s great that chatbots can incorporate rich media like picture and GIFs into conversation. While chatbots primarily communicate through text, images can help chatbots seem more human or showcase a product that’s easier to display than describe.</p>
<p>When I was talking with the Spring bot, once I had determined what types of products I was looking for, it pulled up a few options that I could click on and expand to get more information. There was also the option to add in images and GIFs on my end, and while the chatbot itself didn’t add in an image, I think it could have benefitted the interaction quite a bit and made it seem a little more human.</p>
<h2><strong>It’s almost indistinguishable from a human (when written correctly).</strong></h2>
<p>Your worst fear about chatbots might be that they deliver a clunky, robotic user experience (or, on a more existential level, that they’re coming for all of us and our jobs). However, bots can actually deliver a really seamless, natural human experience when written correctly.</p>
<p>It really depends on what your brand’s voice is, though. If you’re a more informal brand, using slang and casual language (“like,” “love,” etc.) and referring to your brand as “we” or “I” will work well. If you’re a more formal brand, referring to yourself in third person and dropping the slang is probably a better bet.</p>
<p>Spring was more informal, so when the chatbot greeted me with “Hey there!” and referred to itself as “We,” it sounded pretty similar to a human. I almost couldn’t tell the difference between the bot’s responses (left) and the human’s responses (right) when they stepped in.<br />

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Brands are increasingly receptive to using chatbots in their B2C communications. While we’ll have to wait a little bit to see how the chatbot wave plays out over the next few months, early responses and clear benefits just might indicate the rise of chatbots in customer service.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong> </strong>Business communications have traditionally been person to person—someone answers the phone, sends an email, etc. But in recent years, business communications have started incorporating automation in their IVRs, live chats and call routing. In fact, 53.6% of contact centers today use IVRs.</p>
<p>However, some businesses have moved beyond using automation in their business communications—they’re using artificial intelligence. Take <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>, for instance. The popular collaboration platform uses bots to onboard users and <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/08/slack-overrun-bots-friendly-wonderful-bots/">interact with them for a variety of reasons</a>. <a href="https://www.narrativescience.com/">Narrative Science</a>, the natural language generation platform, uses artificial intelligence to draft reports that read just like a human-written report would.</p>
<p><span id="more-7413"></span>These companies are doing extremely well using artificial intelligence for communications, but why? Part of it could be attributed to the fact that AI is well-suited for business communications. AI can process natural language and integrate with other platforms, all while saving your business money.</p>
<p>Here are six reasons why AI and business communications are a great match.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI can process natural language. </strong>Whenever you call into an IVR, you either type in your input or say a word or two to be directed to the next menu option. But what if the system could understand you without you having to speak with stilted dialogue? With AI, callers can talk or type as they normally would and natural language processing can decipher it, leading to an overall better customer experience.</li>
<li><strong>It can help your business be brand compliant. </strong>We’ve all heard of the infamous instances when a contact center agent loses their temper with a customer and calls them a bad name or refuses to let them out of their contract. With AI, your business can circumvent those uncomfortable situations by preprogramming responses to certain keywords, phrases or scenarios. (Just make sure your AI is programmed to be friendly in all scenarios, and learn from Microsoft’s Tay malfunction).</li>
<li><strong>It’s cheaper than live agent interactions but doesn’t replace them. </strong>A typical phone call costs $6-20 per interaction, but an automated interaction, one managed by AI, only costs 25 cents. That’s not to say it should replace live agent interactions—far from it. In fact, AI can learn from live agent interactions and then provide them with the most common solution based on customer input.</li>
<li><strong>It’s something customers want. </strong>Over 40% of customers would rather use self-service than talk to a live agent. AI is a natural extension of self-service. By adding AI to your business communications, your company can help customers self-serve across channels, and, as mentioned above, let them communicate as they normally would.</li>
<li><strong>It’s easy to integrate with other platforms for increased functionality. </strong>AI isn’t hard to implement and add on to. For instance, IBM Watson lets you integrate AI into your own communication solution. Alternatively, you can find a solution that already includes AI. Integrating your AI-powered communication solution with other platforms means your business can deliver more personalized, intelligent service.</li>
<li><strong>AI can help your business be more efficient. </strong>AI is great for handling lots of data, which is why it can be used to handle a lot of common customer inquiries while agents focus on more complex tasks. In both cases, your business ends up making happier customers—they’re getting served quicker via AI, or getting their issue solved more in-depth with help from an agent.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>So how can you add AI to your business communications? </strong></h2>
<p>The best way to start introducing AI into your business communications is through messaging. But why messaging? Let angel investor and prolific author <a href="http://www.nirandfar.com/2015/07/the-message-is-the-medium-3-reasons-apps-as-assistants-work.html">Nir Eyal</a> explain:</p>
<blockquote><p>With text, there are no voice intonations to decipher or accents to understand, no facial gestures to interpret, and no body language to translate. Text is something computers can understand and process quickly and it’s why messaging is a great place for humans and A.I. to work together to serve customer needs.</p></blockquote>
<p>While you can use AI for both voice and text interactions, starting with a medium that AI can understand means your business can have artificial intelligence implemented sooner rather than later. This means your costs will also start to decrease as well, since text communications are cheaper than voice communications, as mentioned above.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>If there was any time to add AI to your business communications, it’s now. Venture capitalists invested more than $300 million in <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-03/i-ll-be-back-the-return-of-artificial-intelligence">AI startups</a> in 2014, a 300% increase over 2013. AI is a growing presence in business communications—will it be part of yours?</p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Empowerment. That is the word that comes to mind when one considers how recent technological changes have affected a business’ ability to create compelling communication experiences. Despite the fact that the basic tools for making a phone call haven’t changed much in the last 150 years (even your smartphone still offers you a standard numeric keypad, not so different from the rotary phones of old), we are entering an age of innovation around communications such that the world has never seen before. And best of all, many of these technologies don’t require heavy-lifting from IT teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the monolithic incumbents in the enterprise communication space that require multi-million dollar upfront investments and multi-year deployment schedules, the future of communication lies in software. Developers are now able to leverage communication APIs to build proofs of concept in hours or days that they can share with their business partners. Similarly, business analysts can leverage drag-and-drop user interfaces to build communication solutions in minutes, without having to request development resources. Never before have both technical people and non-technical people had so much ability to create meaningful solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are real risks and process challenges to account for when trying to build your own communication solution. There are both technological and experiential conditions that you must account for.</span></p>
<h2><span id="more-7386"></span><b>Getting company-wide buy-in</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting company-wide buy-in is crucial for any project’s success, and it is not always easy to ascertain. One of the leading causes of project failure is lack of collaboration; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 85% of employees and executives cite lack of</span><a href="http://work.com/blog/2012/08/is-poor-collaboration-killing-your-company-infographic/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">collaboration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as leading to a project’s failure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Furthermore, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">75% of business and</span><a href="http://www.geneca.com/75-business-executives-anticipate-software-projects-fail/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">IT executives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> think their IT projects are doomed from the start, and project managers say executives ultimately determine what the fate of the project will be</span><a href="http://reports.informationweek.com/abstract/83/12175/IT-Business-Strategy/research-2014-enterprise-project-management-survey.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 63% of the time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, be it elimination or deferment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By taking a new approach (either building a POC on top of a communication API or a Software-as-a-Service application), the “go/no go” discussions will be far more productive. Think of it this way&#8211;in less time than it would take a business analyst to document requirements and engage with their technical counterparts to scope out level of effort, that same person could build a proof of concept and share a working example of a proposed solution to spark more productive conversations with the stakeholders. This makes it easier to achieve a shared vision and more buy-in.</span></p>
<h2><b>Lack of user experience expertise</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication solutions are usually customer facing, thus amplifying the risk associated with introducing a new experience. Creating an ‘on-brand’ customer experience is no small feat, and requires rapid cycles of design, build, test, repeat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaving experience design in the hands of a developer (or skipping the experience design process altogether) is risky; customers have expectations that you’ll likely want to meet and understand.  If they’re not trained in UX design, your developers may end up creating an experience that isn’t on brand and doesn’t improve the relationship with your customers. Furthermore, custom programming a solution may inhibit the ability to iterate rapidly and improve the experience over time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, building a text-messaging notification solution using a communication API provider is quite simple, but developers often neglect the fact that recipients will reply to those text messages and therefore don’t have any response strategy. In addition, if you develop your own solution, you will also have to build a user experience report in order to know where and how the solution can be improved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, using a SaaS application that has productized many features that protect the ability to iterate rapidly based on real data allows for the experience to be improved over time, and without having to request developer resources every time a change is requested. The pace of improvement is therefore instant.</span></p>
<h2><b>Cost of development and maintenance</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers love to build things, but they don’t enjoy the ongoing care and feeding that enterprise communication solutions require. And the ugly truth is that developing a custom solution, rather than configuring it through an existing software application, requires much more investment than you might think. Developing against third-party communication APIs removes nearly all of the complexity surrounding the complicated telephony network, but the normal software costs are still required, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Application monitoring</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infrastructure monitoring</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Load balancing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Database management</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quality assurance testing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infrastructure maintenance</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Benefits of using SaaS applications</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As outlined above, developing your own cloud communication solution can come with some big risks. However, creating it through a SaaS platform offers several key benefits:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b><b>Time to market. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you have a very clear vision for the ideal solution, it can take time to get your solution to where you want it to be and constant change requests burden the development team. With a hosted cloud communication solution, you can get any changes or updates deployed in no time.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Built-in features. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most cloud communication platforms will come with built-in features to eliminate the complexity of custom development. By productizing certain features, including integrations, users can leverage best practices and benefit from features that would otherwise be left in the ‘nice to have’ column and never be developed.. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Flexibility. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hosted cloud solutions come with a lot of flexibility, from custom design for communication flows to integrations to even custom skins that reflect your brand.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Built-in support team. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If something were to go wrong with your own solution, you’d have to devote your own resources to troubleshoot and fix it. With a hosted cloud communication solution, you have a dedicated support team on hand that will diagnose and correct any issues without you having to do a thing.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Business continuity. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of having to custom develop integrations with CRMs or other systems you might use, a hosted cloud solution will usually come with built-in integrations with the most popular CRMs. This way, you can ensure the right data is being passed between your cloud system and CRM. And if you’re using proprietary systems, it is easier to configure a custom integration than it is to develop one.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developing your own cloud communication solution comes with inherent risks and pitfalls. By investing in an existing cloud platform, you’ll save money in the process and be able to provide your customers with a professional, well-designed customer experience.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we look back on 2015, it’s tempting to refer to that age-old adage: “The more things change, the more things stay the same.”</p>
<p>This year, that couldn’t be further from the truth.</p>
<p>That’s because 2015 was the year the technology really made its presence known in customer service. Automation, artificial intelligence, social media, CRM integrations, texting&#8211;all were major customer service trends in 2015.</p>
<h2><span id="more-7370"></span><strong>Customer Service Trends in 2015</strong></h2>
<p>2015 was the year that:</p>
<p><strong>Customer service got smart.</strong> This year, artificial intelligence wasn’t just limited to the realms of science fiction a la Age of Ultron—it was also slowly incorporated into different companies’ service offerings. Amazon made its entry into the home automation market with Alexa, a virtual assistant that can field questions ranging from the time of day to traffic predictions to good restaurants nearby. On the enterprise-level side, IBM continued to expand the capabilities of Jeopardy-winning Watson, adding self-service into varied industries like healthcare, education and finance, among others.</p>
<p><strong>Customer service got automated.</strong> Over <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">55% of customers</a> would like a self-service experience, which provides businesses with the unique opportunity to speed up the customer experience while decreasing costs. In the restaurant industry, established chains like Outback Steakhouse and Olive Garden let customers <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Saving-Money/2015/0514/Restaurant-table-tablets-A-gimmick-or-actually-helpful" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">order via tablets</a>, while market newcomer <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/09/upshot/restaurant-of-the-future-service-with-an-impersonal-touch.html?_r=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eatsa</a> automated the bulk of the food delivery process. Automated self-service also extended to digital channels—companies like <a href="http://www.toistersolutions.com/blog/2015/10/28/automation-fail-how-attcares-stumbled-into-a-tweet-chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AT&amp;T</a> automated social media responses (not always with the best outcome), while <a href="https://www.twilio.com/customers/stories/uber" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uber</a>, Snooze and more texted customers about the status of their ride or table.</p>
<p><strong>Customer service got focused.</strong> Over 80% of companies want to use <a href="https://fonolo.com/blog/2013/09/17-important-customer-experience-statistics-for-the-call-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customer service</a> as a way to differentiate themselves from their competition. But what defines a good customer service experience? In 2015, we interviewed over 60 industry influencers and found that the best way to <a href="http://onereach.com/resources/customer-service-report-2015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improve customer service</a> was to focus on the employee experience. By focusing on employees and treating them with respect, companies can ensure that they pass that goodwill onto customers. Case in point: <a href="https://jobs.zappos.com/why-zappos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zappos</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/about/careers/lifeatgoogle/benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Customer service got diversified.</strong> In 2015, companies made an effort to diversify their service offerings, providing support on established and emerging channels.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mobile.</strong> In 2015, companies increasingly relied on mobile to interact with their customers. This year saw the official launch of Apple Pay, Starbucks’ continued success with mobile app <a href="http://www.nfcworld.com/2015/07/24/336798/one-in-five-starbucks-sales-in-the-us-made-with-mobile-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">payments</a> (more than $9 million in orders processed per week) and Magic’s simple but powerful text concierge service. As mentioned above, more and more companies saw the value of adding texting to their support strategy, making it easier for customers to contact them on a channel they prefer. However, not every attempt to implement mobile customer service was successful—Domino’s unfortunately disappointed some customers with the rollout of its text-to-order service.</p>
<p><strong>Video.</strong> Audiovisual communication has been popular among consumers for years, but 2015 was the year when video really started to gain a foothold in B2C interactions. Amazon’s Mayday is probably the most well-known example, but <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/28/this-is-webrtcs-yearor-is-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Express</a> and other companies helped customers solve their problems over video. WebRTC’s open source nature also made it easier for any company to incorporate video into their service offering.</p>
<p><strong>Social.</strong> 2015 was the year social platforms got serious about customer service interactions. <a href="https://twitter.app.box.com/customer-service-on-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>released a customer service playbook outlining the benefits of using social for customer service, as well as how to apply it to an organization. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/15/facebook-pages-can-now-show-how-quickly-they-respond-to-customers-messages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> also launched a new feature that keeps track of how long it takes company pages to respond to customer messages, giving customers better insight into the responsiveness of an organization. This is especially important, given the fact that over 40% of customers expect a response on <a href="http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-research/42-percent-of-consumers-complaining-in-social-media-expect-60-minute-response-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social</a> in 60 minutes or less.</p>
<p><strong>Voice.</strong> Voice is still king in contact center service interactions, but times are changing. Research from<a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dimension Data</a> found that while voice accounts for 65% of all contact center interactions, digital interactions will surpass voice by the end of 2017. And with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/07/technology/tech-companies-leave-phone-calls-behind.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet-based companies</a> making a concerted attempt to direct customers towards digital, with other companies ditching corporate <a href="http://www.inc.com/associated-press/jpmorgan-chase-getting-rid-of-voicemail-for-some-employees.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">voicemail</a>, it became very clear in that businesses couldn’t just rely on voice for communication.</p>
<p><strong>Web chat</strong>. Over 70% of contact centers will offer web chat by the end of 2016, up from just 33% in 2015. There are several reasons why companies would want to invest in web chat—it’s cheaper than voice, agents can handle multiple conversations at once and respond in real-time, etc. And there’s a reason companies from Nordstrom to Nike are using web chat to interact with customers—while 91% of customers are happy with web chat’s ability to solve customer support issues, 62% of customers are more inclined to buy a product if live chat is available.</p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>Looking ahead to 2016</strong></h2>
<p>2015 was an exciting year for customer service, with lots of progress made in digital interactions and automation. 2016 is set to be an equally exciting year, if not more so, as companies continue to build on the advances made in 2015. We can’t say for sure what will happen in customer service in 2016, but we’ve got a few ideas.</p>
<p>Below are our customer service predictions for 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Continued rise in cloud computing</strong>. In 2016, businesses will continue to migrate to the <a href="http://www.icmi.com/Resources/Technology/2014/05/Is-the-Cloud-Contact-Center-Passing-You-By" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloud</a> for its accessibility, storage, simplicity, and security, among other benefits. In fact, 88% of businesses are currently using the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2015/03/04/new-stats-from-the-state-of-cloud-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public cloud</a>. In addition, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2015/09/27/roundup-of-cloud-computing-forecasts-and-market-estimates-q3-update-2015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner</a> predicts that by 2020, roughly 25% of organizations will use cloud-based CRMs. Cloud-based software-as-a-service, or <a href="http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/technology/publications/global-software-100-leaders/saas-trends.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SaaS</a>, will also become more prevalent, growing at a rate of 21.3% per year and making up 14.2% of software spending. <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/273642/worldwide-software-as-a-service-revenue-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SaaS revenue</a> is predicted to hit $32.8 billion in revenue in 2016, up 17% from 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Delivering on the omnichannel promise. </strong>In 2013, <a href="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zendesk </a>research found that over 85% of customers thought companies needed to do a better job of providing a seamless experience. In 2015, companies were on the right track but weren’t quite there yet—nearly 50% of contact centers named integration of Web, contact center and CRM systems as their top challenge, with <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">integration</a> of systems to enable channel hopping close behind (41%). We predict that in 2016, companies will continue to take steps toward providing an omnichannel experience. Companies will find and use service platforms that manage and can integrate with multiple service channels/CRMs and similar systems.</p>
<p><strong>Personalization.</strong> This trend is a combination of the previous two trends—cloud services will enable companies to provide a personalized experience across channels. We predict that the ability to integrate customer data into service interactions will become increasingly mainstream in 2016, both in response to <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/07/14/consumers-want-privacy-yet-demand-personalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consumer demand</a> and a desire to differentiate on great <a href="https://fonolo.com/blog/2013/09/17-important-customer-experience-statistics-for-the-call-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customer experiences</a>. The SaaS pricing model of most cloud services will also make it easy for businesses of any size to provide great customer service.</p>
<p><strong>Proactive customer service.</strong> <a href="http://www.wired.com/insights/2014/11/the-internet-of-things-bigger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Internet of Things</a> is rapidly changing our personal and professional lives. IoT-based companies, but other businesses as well, will leverage customer data to provide a proactive service experience. Although IoT is primarily focused on the B2C experience (think FitBit or any smartfridge), other organizations can learn from IoT innovations. Take, for example, the proactive service experience industry pundits anticipate will take shape in the IoT industry: <a href="http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Web-Exclusives/Viewpoints/Revolutionizing-Customer-Service-with-the-Internet-of-Things-105722.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner</a> predicts that by 2018, five percent of IoT devices will automatically trigger service cases.</p>
<p><strong>More artificial intelligence.</strong> In 2016, AI will continue to get smarter, and its presence in business will continue to grow. This is evidenced by the amount of <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/artificial-intelligence-in-business-the-state-of-play-and-future-prospects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">venture capital</a> being put toward AI-centered businesses, which grew from $75 million in 2013 to $300 million in 2014. And while <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/artificial-intelligence-in-business-the-state-of-play-and-future-prospects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artificial intelligence</a> is primarily being used for voice recognition and response, <a href="http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Editorial/Magazine-Features/The-2015-CRM-Rising-Stars-IBMs-Watson-Brings-Cognitive-Computing-to-Customer-Support-102108.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner</a> predicts that 10% of computers will be able to learn from past interactions by 2017. At OneReach, we’re helping to make this possible through the use of AI in IVRs or self-service.</p>
<p><strong>Moving towards a mobile-first future.</strong> Our world is becoming increasingly mobilized—nearly two billion global citizens now own a <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/2-Billion-Consumers-Worldwide-Smartphones-by-2016/1011694" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smartphone</a>. This mobile change extends to customer service, where 62% of companies think <a href="http://www.icmi.com/About-ICMI/Press-Room/2013-Mobile-Customer-Service-Strategy-Results-Released" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobile service</a> is a competitive differentiator and 64% of customers would prefer to text customer service. Texting is poised to make a big gain in the customer service field, with more than 60% of <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact centers</a>offering it by 2017. In 2016, we predict that companies will continue to provide customer service on mobile devices, whether it’s via text message, mobile applications, mobile websites, or other channels.</p>
<p><strong>More digital/emerging channels.</strong> As mentioned above, customer service interactions will shift to focus on emerging digital channels, both in response to consumer preference and cost savings. Take, for instance, the increased use emerging channels: One in four contact centers will offer <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> by the end of 2017, one in two contact centers will offer a smartphone app by the end of 2017, and three out of five contact centers will offer texting/IM by the end of 2017.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>2015 was a big year for customer service, and 2016 is set to be an even bigger one. We predict that new applications of technology like artificial intelligence and automation will define customer service in the coming years, as they already have today. Companies and contact centers that embrace the customer service trends in 2015 and beyond are poised to make an impact on the market that will be felt for years to come.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you stop and think about it, Twitter and text messaging aren’t so different. They both have limited characters (140 and 160), they’re both fast-moving channels, and they’re both widely-used channels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how widely-used? Let’s take a look.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-7354"></span><img class="size-full wp-image-2237 aligncenter" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/compare2.png" alt="twitter vs sms" width="600" height="258" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right—texting is used 46 times </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than Twitter on any given day. But that’s not the only way Twitter and texting are different. There are</span><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/04/28/47-percent-of-brands-dont-use-twitteror-do-they/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">63 million active Twitter users in the U.S.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, compared to</span><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">309 million text messaging users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In addition,</span><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">74% of smartphone users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> check social media every day, </span><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/#smartphones"><span style="font-weight: 400;">compared to 97% of texters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why is it that more brands are on Twitter than use text messaging?</span></i></p>
<p><a href="http://marketingland.com/study-92-percent-of-top-brands-tweet-avg-12x-per-day-audiences-grew-20-percent-in-q4-71199"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 98% of top brands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are on Twitter, but almost no one knows companies are using SMS. You have to navigate to the contact us page, look for the phone number, and even then it might not be text-enabled. </span><a href="https://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you look at the contact center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, text and social are a little more evenly matched (43% social to 37% text messaging), but social still takes the lead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While businesses may be focused on rolling out social channels, customers are more interested in using text messaging. Research has found that while</span><a href="http://www.parature.com/social-love-it-leave-it/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">37% of online adults</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have used social for customer service, research has found that</span><a href="http://www.eweek.com/networking/consumers-like-using-text-messages-to-solve-customer-service-issues.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">75% of customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">prefer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to use texting over social media. And brands that use text messaging successfully have been able to reach</span><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylsnappconner/2013/11/12/fifty-essential-mobile-marketing-facts/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">95% of smartphone and non-smartphone users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while top brands that use social media only reach</span><a href="https://www.forrester.com/Social+Relationship+Strategies+That+Work/fulltext/-/E-RES113002"> <b>2% of their followers</b></a><b>.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But why are social brands only able to reach such a small percentage of their followers when texting can reach so many? Part of it might be because social messages are public, not private.</span></p>
<h2><b>Twitter vs SMS: The Key Differences</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing that really differentiates texting from Twitter is that it’s truly one to one. There’s no massive social audience—it’s just you and the company. On Twitter, it’s a great, big social world where </span><a href="https://moz.com/blog/when-is-my-tweets-prime-of-life"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the average half life of a tweet is 18 minutes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With so many messages being shared in a social shouting match, it’s no wonder 40% of tweets get no response, according to </span><a href="https://twitter.app.box.com/customer-service-on-twitter"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter’s customer service handbook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Compare that to text messaging, which has a </span><a href="http://mobilemarketingwatch.com/sms-marketing-wallops-email-with-98-open-rate-and-only-1-spam-43866/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">98% open rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a </span><a href="https://www.marketingtechblog.com/text-messaging/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">45% response rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s another key difference that separates Twitter and texting. On Twitter, brands might be more inclined to care than over SMS because situations can escalate out of control in the public eye. When messages are public, there’s a higher chance of misinterpretation and negativity, with some customers resorting to social because they know they’ll get a response. Part of the reason companies are on Twitter is to be part of the conversation, be it positive or negative. If customers could just start spamming customers over text messaging, companies might be more interested in using it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s one final difference where we look at Twitter vs SMS: you can’t successfully automate Twitter because it’s so front-facing and public. In fact,</span><a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/76915#replies-mentions"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter itself frowns on automated responses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (emphasis added):</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reply and mention functions are intended to make communication between users easier, and automating these processes in order to reach many users is considered an abuse of the feature…</span><b>media or brands using auto-response campaigns must request approval from Twitter and may be subject to additional rules. </b></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands using automated responses have also raised eyebrows,</span><a href="http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/brands-auto-replies-twitter/496033"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">much to the chagrin of customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-2263 aligncenter" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bofa_occupy_auto_tweet.jpg" alt="twitter vs sms" width="565" height="360" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the cost savings that come with automation, automating Twitter responses is a bad practice for brands. But while some brands can get away with it, they still often require customers to pass along their personal information or switch to another channel, like voice, to get the help they need. Not a very good customer experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about it this way: how would callers feel if you asked them to tweet you instead of connecting with an agent? That would be a very disjointed customer experience that didn’t even get you the help you needed. And can you get people from your IVR to web-chat? NOPE. But guess what &#8211; you can transition callers from your IVR, hold or call queues to SMS-based self-service or live SMS support.</span></p>
<h2><b>Enter the Channel Pivot</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Twitter’s proclamations that companies need to put Twitter first for customer service, voice still reigns supreme as the top service channel. </span><a href="https://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 65% of contact center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> actions are over voice, and virtually all contact centers offer phone support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right here is where texting can fill the gap that Twitter can’t. With </span><a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/channel-pivot-how-switching-from-voice-to-sms-benefits-everyone/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">channel pivot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, customers can seamlessly switch from voice to text without losing track of where they were in the conversation. When customers come calling (and that’s most likely the channel they’ll use), they can have the option to pivot to text to speak with a live agent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Twitter, the only channel you can pivot to is Direct Message. If you want to get things fully resolved, you’ll have to either call in or visit their website for more in-depth information. That’s why channel pivot between voice and text is great for the customer. Channel pivot gives customers the flexibility to engage with a company on their terms. If it’s loud outside, customers can pivot to text to talk with a company. If they’re sharing sensitive information, customers can switch back to voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Channel pivot is also great for companies. Switching a call from voice to text decreases the cost of the session immensely (</span><a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/analystreports/enterprise-application/forrester-tei-atg-359304.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$6-20 per session</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="http://www.providesupport.com/about-us/articles/live-chat-increases-satisfaction.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about $1 per session</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Companies can also look at what points in their IVR are customers switching to text messaging, then offer texting as a first option for customers when they reach that spot in the IVR.</span></p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers spend a lot of time using social media—there’s no arguing that. However, they spend far more time using text messaging. Customers also would prefer to text a company over using social media. That’s not to say that companies should abandon social media, but rather take into consideration offering channels that customers are using.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you had to choose where to spend money, ask yourself where customers are spending their time: on social media or text messaging?</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tired of ordering pizza over the phone? Domino’s understands—that’s why they’ve launched <a href="anyware.dominos.com">AnyWare</a>, letting you “order your favorite oven-baked goodness on your favorite devices.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not going to lie—this is a pretty awesome use case (in theory). With AnyWare, you can text, tweet and even use your Smart TV to order pizza and more, and all you have to do is send a pizza emoji.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-7253"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D1SrOjuBSEU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Easy as (pizza) pie, right?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not so much, which kinda sucks because I was really excited by the prospect of being able to text to order a pizza. (No really, I was).</span></p>
<p><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-text-1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1743 size-medium" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-text-1-264x300.png" alt="dominos text 1" width="264" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See, the key to ordering pizza from Domino’s on any of your smart devices lies in creating a Pizza Profile apparently, where you have to input your name, email address, and phone number to get your hands on that slice of cheese. By creating an account, you’re able to Easy Order based off of past purchases and skip entering your personal payment information every time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re all about text messaging and effortless service at OneReach, so this seemed like a great use case to test out. Pizza + texting = success, right?!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excited with the thought of pizza for lunch, and with my stomach growling, I went off to create my Pizza Profile. However, hitting the site should have been my first clue as to what I was about to experience because apparently you have to divulge your deepest, darkest secrets to order a pizza. After logging in to enable text ordering, I was presented with a whole lot of pizza legalese asking for my consent.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1744" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos1-546x331.png" alt="dominos1" width="546" height="331" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I entered my phone number and saved my settings. Next, I had to double opt-in to confirm that I did, in fact, want to order pizza.  </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/dominos-text-2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1741 size-medium" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-text-2-e1440719073409-289x300.png" alt="dominos text 2" width="289" height="300" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, I had to set up an Easy Order (oh, how I wish it had been) so the system knew what to query. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-double-optin.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1745 size-large" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-double-optin-546x255.png" alt="dominos double optin" width="546" height="255" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost done? I wish! The pop-up told me I had to place my order </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">online</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before I could use text messaging. Honestly, I kind of got the feeling this was a cash grab to get everyone to order way more pizzas than they need, all for supposed convenience’s sake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was at a loss. I didn’t even know </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">where </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to place my Easy Order. Luckily, my phone came to my rescue when I opted in to receive messages and I could start placing my Easy Order.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just kidding&#8211;I had to go back online </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">again</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So far, not so easy.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/dominos-text-4.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1747 size-medium" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-text-4-e1440719030547-289x300.png" alt="dominos text 4" width="289" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, I don’t want to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheese it up</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—I just want to order my damn pizza over text message.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C’mon, this is supposed to be easy! I just want to order my pizza over text message!!</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, on the payment page, I found what I was looking for.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-easy-order.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1750" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-easy-order.png" alt="dominos easy order" width="318" height="142" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awesome. Easy Order saved. Right? Wrong. Even though I submitted my order (14” with pepperoni and mushrooms), I still had no Easy Order to show for it. At this point, I was getting really frustrated (and hungry).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to be deterred, I tried once again to order over text, but because I didn’t save my credit card information, I couldn’t order. Because guess what—the only way to update your payment method is to MAKE ANOTHER PAYMENT.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-credit-card-2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1751" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-credit-card-2-546x73.png" alt="dominos credit card 2" width="546" height="73" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seriously. Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still aiming for my end goal of ordering pizza over text message, I went back <em>online</em> to order something cheap (3 20 oz. sodas) to re-enter my payment information. And when I went back to my phone and texted my little pizza emoji, guess what? Still didn’t work, because life sucks sometimes.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/dominos-text-5.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1752 size-medium" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-text-5-e1440718690657-289x300.png" alt="dominos text 5" width="289" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, the delivery guy was nice enough to deliver my two orders together, and when I asked if my online credit card payment went through (because according to the texts, it wasn’t valid), he showed me the receipt, where it clearly did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, not only was I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> able to order over text message, but I had a heck of a time even trying to order online.</span></p>
<p>The goal of this article is not to bash Domino’s&#8211;they should be applauded for even attempting to deploy a text-to-order service. In addition, I’m assuming that once I got my Easy Order set up, it would have been as easy to order as advertised instead of what I went through.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1753" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1753" style="width: 546px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-happy.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-1753" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-happy-546x287.png" alt="This is definitely not how I felt after trying to order. Photo from Domino&quot;sss" width="546" height="287" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1753" class="wp-caption-text">This is definitely NOT how I felt after trying to order. Photo from Domino&#8217;s AnyWare video.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, what’s ultimately lacking from the Domino’s AnyWare experience is the “anywhere” aspect of it. Domino’s tried and failed to create a seamless omnichannel experience that lets you order pizza whenever, wherever, and however you want. It relied too heavily on the Web to enable an experience that should have taken place largely on other channels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A true omnichannel experience would have seamlessly transferred customers from channel to channel (ie a link to a secure payment page for ordering), rather than forcing them back to the Web to do the very thing they should have been able to do by texting or tweeting: order pizza.</span></p>
<h1><b>Text Domino’s 2.0</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though I didn’t get my pizza over text message, I still wanted to see if there was a better way to design this whole text debacle. Because even though it didn’t work, it should have worked. And it can work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how it should have been done (and can be done). Domino’s, feel free to use this model PUH-LEESE!</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, I would text into Domino’s, without needing a Pizza Profile. That was the one part of the user experience that continuously failed me, </span><a href="http://www.eater.com/2015/5/20/8631373/i-ordered-dominos-pizza-emoji-it-took-three-hours-twitter"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and I’m not</span></a> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/20/dominos-tweet-to-order-system-isnt-as-great-as-it-sounds/#.v3rtkt:wfb2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the only one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Had I not been so committed to seeing this through, I would have bailed with many profanities following and ordered from Papa John’s.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would receive a text message asking if I’d like to place my usual order (not Easy Order, because that sure as heck wasn’t easy), or if I’d like to place a new one.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system would already know my address and billing information, so I wouldn’t have to input that information online, taking me out of my mobile experience. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d confirm that I’d like the pizza delivered to my regular address.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system would then ask me if I’d like to pay with the card I already have on file.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d confirm, and then I’d get a message that my pizza was on my way.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy as that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, why tell you when I can show you? Here’s how it would look&#8230;</span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-2388 aligncenter" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dominos-texting2.png" alt="text dominos" width="301" height="573" /></p>
<p>Want to try a great text-to-order experience for yourself? <strong>Text “PIZZA” to 70700.</strong> Note&#8211;you won’t actually be ordering pizza, and there are no integrations to find the nearest Domino’s or to pay for pizza. Still, it’s an example of what a smart ordering experience could be (and should have been) like.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy!</span></p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How many text messages do you think the average American exchanges each month? 100? 500?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-number-of-texts-sent-2013-3">Try 914</a>. That’s roughly 30 texts a day, or more than double that if you’re between the ages of 18-24.</p>
<p>Now, a good chunk of those text message conversations in your personal life will be conversational (&#8220;I miss you”, &#8220;Just a reminder to pick up the kids”, “Great to see you last night!”) but many others are transactional (“I’ll pick up the kids if you make dinner- deal?&#8221;)</p>
<p>Up until recently, these kinds of messages were only sent from person to person, not business to customer. However, more and more businesses are starting to see the value of letting their customers interact with them using their preferred communication channel: SMS.</p>
<h1><span id="more-7236"></span>How customers want to use transactional SMS</h1>
<p><a href="http://onereach.com/resources/high-demand-for-text-message-2014-report.html">A 2014 study</a> conducted by Harris Poll and commissioned by OneReach found that 64% of customers would rather text than call for customer support. The study found that customers would prefer to use text for the following activities:</p>
<ol>
<li>      Check order status (38%)</li>
<li>     Schedule or change appointments (32%)</li>
<li>      Make or confirm reservations (31%)</li>
<li>     Ask a question (30%)</li>
<li>     Find a store location (30%)</li>
<li>       Check balances or due dates (30%)</li>
<li>      Refill orders (29%)</li>
<li>     Reset password (27%)</li>
</ol>
<p>What all of these tasks have in common are that they can be easily resolved without the need of an agent. By adding automation, customers can achieve effortless resolution quickly and easily.</p>
<p>Think about it: if you had to renew a magazine subscription, would you rather call in and talk to someone for this relatively simple transaction, or simply reply ‘yes’ to a text message? We’re betting there’s a 64% chance you’d use text.</p>
<p>Letting customers achieve transactional resolution through self-service causes customer satisfaction to go up and the costs associated with performing these transactions to go down.</p>
<p>But how?</p>
<h1>How businesses can provide transactional SMS</h1>
<h2>Choose a messaging provider that can easily connect with your APIs</h2>
<p>You’re not going to want to manually answer simple questions about office hours or prescription refills&#8211;it would take too long to look up each customer’s information and get back to them. That’s why it’s important to pick a messaging provider that can integrate with your CRM or any other data sources. This way, when a customer texts in, the system will recognize the number and automatically incorporate their information into a series of texts. A proper integration will be able to update your databases, process payments, and complete tasks without relying on a human agent.</p>
<h2>Let your customers initiate contact with you via SMS</h2>
<p>Your text channel isn’t going to help any customers if they don’t know it exists. Put the call to action to text on your website, in your emails, on social, or even in your IVR . You could even go old school and put it on flyers, posters or business cards—anything to get the message out and increase engagement. By inviting customers to start a conversation over SMS, you can deflect call traffic before it even starts (not to mention save dollars per interaction).</p>
<h2>Allow callers to transition from voice to text via “<a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=499">channel pivot</a>”</h2>
<p>The Harris Poll study found that 81% of customers get frustrated by waiting on hold, something that we all pretty much knew. What you might not know is that 44% of customers would prefer to text chat with an agent immediately rather than wait on hold. Offering customers the option to channel pivot allows them to use the channel they prefer, but also opens up phone lines for customers that really need to talk things out with an agent. For example, you might include this message in your IVR: “Thanks for calling! It looks like your account has been locked. Press * to reset your password via text message or continue to hold for the next available agent.”</p>
<h2>Send well-timed outbound messages that your audience can actually reply to</h2>
<p>Most outbound SMS campaigns ask customers to reply with a phone call or email, which ends up disrupting their customer experience. Rather than seamlessly moving to another channel and maintaining context (like with channel pivot), customers have to start their conversation over on a new channel. According to Accenture, <a href="http://www.accenture.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/PDF/Accenture-Global-Consumer-Pulse-Research-Study-2013-Key-Findings.pdf">89% of customers</a> get frustrated having to repeat themselves, so if you’re going to send outbound texts to customers, make sure they can text you back. (Pro tip: to increase your response rate, segment customers by time zone to make sure they see your message.)</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>If you want to get transactional SMS up and running ASAP, you’re in luck. Your messaging provider should be able to light-up a pilot in a few days to track how well this works for you and your customers. From there, you can rapidly iterate on the experience and before you know it, you’ll be helping more customers than ever and saving money.</p>
<p>Sound good?</p>
<p>Good.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three weeks ago, a devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Nepal, killing 7,000 people and displacing millions. Homes were leveled, monuments were reduced to rubble, and a people were shaken.</p>
<p>In the hours that followed, aid organizations rushed into action, mobilizing medical personnel and rescue workers in response to the crisis. Organizations like Doctors Without Borders and global Red Cross societies organized search and rescue efforts, tended to the wounded and distributed supplies.</p>
<p>Then, a second earthquake hit.</p>
<p>Across the world, countries have put forth millions of dollars in aid, <a href="http://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/may-5-2015-usaid-announces-11-million-additional-assistance-nepal-earthquake"> with the U.S. alone pledging $26 million</a>. On a smaller scale, global citizens have made donations of their own, whether online, over the phone or through text messaging. But in the wake of a disaster, it’s important not only to only to have donations set up—it’s important to have communications as well.</p>
<h1><span id="more-7233"></span>How to communicate in a disaster</h1>
<p><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/text-response.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1542 size-medium" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/text-response-300x300.png" alt="text response" width="300" height="300" /></a>In the aftermath of a disaster, people are trying to find loved ones, shelter, and food and water. In the United States, FEMA sends out<a href="https://www.fema.gov/frequently-asked-questions-wireless-emergency-alerts"> Wireless Emergency Alerts</a> when disasters strike. These messages detail actions residents in afflicted areas should take, as well as the agency sending the message. Residents can also<a href="http://www.fema.gov/text-messages"> text the short code 43362 (4FEMA)</a> with the keyword SHELTER and their zip code to find shelter near them.</p>
<p>You might be asking why texting and not, say, a mobile app. One reason is that a lot more people use feature phones than smartphones in developing nations. Take the United States and Nepal, for instance. Mobile phone penetration is about<a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/222307/forecast-of-mobile-phone-penetration-in-the-us/"> 80% in the United States</a>, with about<a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/#smartphones"> 64% penetration for smartphones</a>. In contrast, mobile phone penetration is at<a href="http://www.nta.gov.np/en/2012-06-01-11-33-01/mis-archives/mis-reports/nta-mis-85/download"> 79% in Nepal</a>, but is only at<a href="http://www.nepalitelecom.com/2015/03/top-ten-phone-makers-market-in-nepal.html"> about 20% for smartphones</a>.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that mobile apps and the Internet aren’t valuable post-crisis, but in Nepal,<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2915012/nepal-communications-hit-by-power-outage-lastmile-issues.html"> when links aren’t going through</a> and the Internet is slow, text might be the only option. Case in point: after the earthquake,<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/04/27/how-google-and-facebook-are-finding-victims-of-the-nepal-earthquake/"> Google deployed its Person Finder tool</a>, where global citizens could search for a missing person with SMS (shown here with the US search phone number).</p>
<p><a href="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/text-response2.png"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-1543 alignright" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/text-response2-300x300.png" alt="text response2" width="300" height="300" /></a>Google had experience from past disasters like the Boston bombing and the earthquake/nuclear disaster at Fukushima. Similarly, the U.S. government has also been more prepared with disaster communications. After Hurricane Katrina,<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2506949/mobile-wireless/communication-key-to-post-disaster-survival.html"> major carriers mobilized portable cell towers</a> and made necessary repairs. In addition, <a href="http://www.disasterready.org/blog/humanitarian-aid-workers-increasingly-use-smartphones-online-learning">today’s relief workers</a> do have smartphones, which become tools to make things happen when communication is at its peak.</p>
<p>So what’s the most effective way to communicate in a disaster? According to the FCC, many times<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/emergency-communications-tips"> text messages will go through</a> when calls won’t,<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/31/uk-usa-weather-storms-idUSLNE84U01D20120531"> a sentiment FEMA echoes</a>. After the Boston bombing,<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3008458/tech-forecast/why-your-phone-doesnt-work-during-disasters-and-how-fix-it"> carriers urged customers to use texting</a> because they take up less bandwidth than voice. Text is not only a highly used channel&#8211;it’s also the only one that might get through.</p>
<h1>Preparing for the worst</h1>
<p>Google and American Red Cross are big organizations, so they’re able to rapidly deploy preexisting communication solutions. However, not all organizations have a communication solution in place, and they need to get one up and running quickly. And sometimes the magnitude of the disaster might wipe out the wireless network or cell towers.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s important to have a solution in place beforehand, if possible. Solutions like OneReach can be deployed in under an hour, and in the midst of a disaster, every second counts. Whatever platform you do use, make sure you have the right kind of number. Short codes can send more messages per minute than <a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=534">long codes</a>, but they typically take three months to provision, so plan ahead.</p>
<p>The next step is activating the flow before the disaster hits. This way, you can get people the answers they need even if your Internet connection goes down, because the phone number is stored in the cloud. If communications are restored after a disaster, you can then create additional outbound flows for people to engage with. One best practice is to get people to opt-in to updates and disaster notifications beforehand, instead of having to rely on inbound numbers that might get overwhelmed (or maybe not even seen at all).</p>
<p>But it’s not enough to get your message out—it’s important for people to read it, especially after a disaster. Text has a 98% open rate, so if an organization needs to get an important message out, there’s no better channel to use for maximum exposure. However, sometimes people want more information than an outbound alert provides, and sometimes the network bandwidth is overwhelmed. That’s why it’s so essential to create two-way text communication flows, to get people the answers they need as soon as possible.</p>
<p>However, text messaging won’t always be enough, as some citizens will want to call. You may not be able to answer everything, which is where automation comes in. If people contact you with the same question, you can create automated flows so people can get the answers they need via text while leaving space for more pressing calls. Questions about shelter, food and water, people&#8211;all of those can be managed through an automated voice or text flow that directs people to different questions based on their input.</p>
<p>If residents do need more specific information, they can also talk to an agent over text chat. The important part is that people are able to get their questions answered.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In the wake of a disaster, information can be as vital as food and water. By enabling a text solution before, during and after disaster strikes, organizations can get people the information they need on a reliable channel. And after your world gets shaken, having something you can count on is everything.</p>
