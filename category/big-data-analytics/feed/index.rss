								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s the coolest part of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iron Man </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">movies? The elaborate fight scenes? The dream team-ups? Tony Stark’s acerbic wit?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At <a href="onereach.com">OneReach</a>, some of us think the coolest part of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iron Man</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> movies is the artificial intelligence that helps power Tony Stark’s armor and business operations. That’s right—we’re talking about J.A.R.V.I.S., Tony’s occasionally sassy but always helpful personal assistant/user interface.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-7268"></span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1869" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/artificial-intelligence-in-business.gif" alt="artificial intelligence in business" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual assistant services like Magic and GoButler already exist, but requests are all managed by real people on the other end. And while there are services like My Second that incorporate artificial intelligence into their service offering, there’s nothing on the level of J.A.R.V.I.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siri is probably the most ubiquitous example of artificially intelligent personal assistant, but she’s more of a recommendation engine than true AI. Similarly, Echo, Amazon’s sparkling new home automation assistant, can only respond to simple voice commands. However, Echo’s functionality is beefed up once you add in the fact that Echo can connect to other apps to access their capabilities.</span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KkOCeAtKHIc" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what happens when AI technology reaches the realms of sci-fi? It won’t just slightly change how we do things—it’ll dramatically transform the way we live and work.</span></p>
<h1><b>Artificial Intelligence in Daily Life</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a digital personal assistant would make life so much easier. Small tasks would get taken care of without a thought, and big tasks would be aided with insightful input. We already connect to the Internet, but AI would integrate it into our daily lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, let’s say you have an AI like Echo that connects not just to other apps, but to the Internet of Things. After you go for a run, your FitBit would connect to your AI with your exercise statistics. You could then ask Echo what you should have for breakfast, and, after connecting to your smart fridge to see what food is available and reviewing your exercise statistics, would suggest an egg white omelet with tomatoes and mushrooms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, just like in the video, an AI digital assistant would make search queries easier than ever. AIs today can only answer simple search queries (ie “Find a restaurant near me”) but in the future, through the use of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and other technologies, they’ll be able to answer complex, contextual questions. In fact, IBM Watson is already on its way there.</span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P18EdAKuC1U" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h1><strong>Artificial Intelligence in Business</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watson and Echo may not have J.A.R.V.I.S-level intelligence yet, but companies can still utilize AI technology in a meaningful way. In fact, companies are already using AI in the form of automation for call routing, automated replies, personalization, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While humans can sometimes be biased and limited by their own knowledge, AI could compensate for human limitations by doing something that many of us can’t: taking a huge amount of information, analyzing it, and boiling it down to a few different options &#8211; quickly.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1871" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/choices.gif" alt="choices" width="245" height="200" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But let’s put it into practice. For example, let’s say you added Echo’s capabilities to your call center tomorrow. If people text in and 80% of them select option 5, AIs like Echo can shift option 5 to the first option to better meet customer needs. AIs can also provide canned responses to agents so that they can not only respond to customer questions quickly, but also track agent-customer interactions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, if 80% of customers are calling in about outages, AI can pretty accurately guess what customers are calling in for. It can analyze input and responses quickly, then learn from that for future interactions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what would AI look like on J.A.R.V.I.S.’s level?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI would be able to pull customer information up in an instant, review past interactions, and determine that you’re probably calling because your printer’s lifetime warranty has expired and it’s no longer working. If that wasn’t the correct response, the AI digital assistant would observe and learn from agent interactions over a series of calls and track probable causes or anticipate trends. For example, if five people call about a broken printer, the AI could inform the agent that that’s what calls are most likely about and what the broken part is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite all that AI is capable of, there will always be a need for human interaction, because some customers will prefer it. And while AI is very good at repeating information, there’s nothing like a human touch to get someone through a difficult conversation (although some people might prefer AI).</span></p>
<h1><b>Conclusion</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI is a powerfully transformative tool that will be responsible for changing our personal and professional lives. It’s a somewhat frightening proposition, almost too fathom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, we’ve got something to explain it to us.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">One of our clients has seven telephony providers&#8211;we are the eighth. Thankfully, we’re helping them consolidate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over the last six weeks, we’ve been able to migrate 60 percent of their traffic to the OneReach platform. Good for us, right? But even better for them.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7184"></span>By consolidating vendors, they’ve been able to save themselves time, money, and a heck of a lot of stress. And guess what? You business can do this too. Check out great benefits of consolidation below:</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Centralized management on any scale</h1>
<p dir="ltr">In a centralized company, the most important decisions are made by higher-ups or headquarters instead of branch managers&#8211;decisions are made in one central location and passed downwards. Not only does this save branch managers time, it also ensures that the customer experience is <a href="http://yourbusiness.azcentral.com/advantage-disadvantage-centralizing-management-control-6635.html">consistent</a> and <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc539020.aspx">efficient</a> anywhere in the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">By letting headquarters make the important decisions, everyone reaps the benefits: headquarters can use their knowledge and experience to the company’s advantage, giving branch managers the time to focus on staff, who can then focus on customers. It’s a win-win-win-win scenario.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Centralized data and analytics</h1>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.techradar.com/us/news/world-of-tech/the-importance-of-big-data-analytics-in-business-1267606">According to Gartner analyst Svetlana Sicular</a>, &#8220;Big data is a way to preserve context that is missing in the refined structured data stores.” This might sound complicated, but what she’s basically that data is stronger united than it is divided.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, a lot of companies have their data divided. Each department or branch collects different types of data based on what’s important to them (i.e. channel preferences, purchase history, etc). and stores it in different locations. It’s difficult for businesses to make informed decisions when they aren’t looking at the whole picture.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, centralized data and analytics aim to change all that. <a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=584">Storing data in one central location</a> means employees can retrieve branch-specific or company-wide data in exactly the same place. This provides a better idea of what’s going on company-wide, but also helps them relate data points that had previously been separated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Centralizing data works equally well for customer insight: instead of reaching out to marketing about a customer’s communication preferences, sales can find that information in exactly the same place marketing does.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Increased context</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Centralization and consolidation can be just as great for your customers as it is for your company. After all, customers shouldn’t have to jump from department to department or channel to channel to get the answers they need. The same information should be available regardless of who they contact or how they contact them.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=540">One way to do this is with screen pops</a>—notifications that provide agents with relevant customer information. Instead of going into a customer call blind, agents can then personalize their conversations based on the customer’s past interactions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Automated solutions like IVR can do this too. Instead of presenting each customer with the same generic prompt, your IVR can review Customer A’s past interactions, see that their car is due for a tune-up, then provide them with an immediate option to do so.</p>
<h1 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Reducing the number of vendors you have isn’t an easy decision to make, and it shouldn’t be. It’s a big leap for any company, but if you do it right, it can be a positive one, too.</p>
