<h2><span id="more-7439"></span></h2>
<h2><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/03/what-businesses-need-to-understand-about-chatbots/?ncid=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29&amp;sr_share=facebook">What Businesses Need to Understand about Chatbots</a>&#8211; by <a href="http://@LirazMargalit">Liraz Margalit </a></h2>
<p>You have been slammed with the topic of bots and the details of them, but why do businesses need to understand them? Bots have the potential to provide greater conveniences than apps because they can understand &#8220;natural speech patterns and provide the personal touch in an impersonal user interface.&#8221; If understood and utilized correctly, chatbots have the power to help business grow in many ways.</p>
<h2><a href="http://customerthink.com/the-power-of-personal-brands-in-customer-service/">The Power of Personal Brands in Customer Service</a>&#8211; by <a href="http://@LarryAlton3">Larry Alton </a></h2>
<p>Most businesses have implemented the use of social media as a way to interact with customers, however, there’s an additional source of reach and power that many firms aren’t aware of, so it largely remains untapped: personal brands. Read more to identify the advantages and potentially improve your customer strategy.</p>

<p>The experience a customer has with a company will, more times than not, determine if that customer returns to the brand or takes their business elsewhere. Providing great experiences for your customers doesn&#8217;t end with your front line, it&#8217;s the entire company&#8217;s responsibility. See how every department within a company can (and should) get involved.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy Friday! Here’s our picks for the best customer service, customer experience, bot and mobile articles of the week, in no particular order.</p>
<h2><span id="more-7438"></span></h2>
<h2><span style="font-size: x-large;"><a href="http://customerthink.com/customer-centricity-is-more-than-promotional-hype/">Customer-Centricity is more than Promotional Hype</a> &#8211; by Mitchell Goozé</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">How do companies drive emotional engagement and guarantee they are fully committed to the needs of the customer? According to this article, centricity is key. Providing better customer service will ultimately end up in more profit, which is almost always the end goal for companies. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: x-large;"><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ibm/2016/06/20/how-to-architect-a-cognitive-future-for-business/#305197e0b173">How to Architect a Cognitive Future for Business </a> &#8211; by <a href="http://@TomRosamilia">Tom Rosamilia</a></span></h2>
<p>Many businesses are looking at the wide-spread possibilities of artificial intelligence to redefine their industries, businesses and customers. Business leaders are embracing artificial intelligence because consumers are using cognitive applications through phones and in their cars, creating better customer engagement.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: x-large;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/21/the-hidden-risks-of-the-bot-explosion/">The Hidden Risks of the Bot Explosion</a>&#8211; by <a href="http://@JenniferLSnell">Jennifer Snell</a> </span></h2>
<p>Whenever something new is introduced people are naturally skeptical about jumping into it. Building trust between humans and machines is very important and, like any relationship, takes time. People will only trust their bots if they trust the makers of their bots. At OneReach we want to make sure customers trust that we’re acting responsibly behind the curtain, and that we value the significance of their customer experience.</p>

<p>The newest technologies have an amazing capacity to make customer service more effective. Knowing that 40% of customers prefer to handle issues on their own, technology can reduce the effort put forth in order to get their issues resolved.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This guest post is written by <i>Stephan Delbos</i>, <i>Editor &amp; Content Manager at </i><a href="http://www.brandembassy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Brand Embassy</i></a><i>.</i></em></p>
<p>The hype surrounding Facebook’s chatbot announcement made it seem like some people were envisioning a <i>Transformers</i>-like takeover of customer service by bots. The introduction of chatbots into digital customer service is great because bots are fast and very efficient. But humans still have a huge role to play in customer service and always will. It might be less dramatic than a chatbot coup d&#8217;état, but the future of customer service lies in the balance between automation and human connections. Knowing the undeniable advantages of chatbots and making use of them, while also giving human agents the freedom to connect with customers will be the key to providing responsive, personalized service that delights customers and inspires their loyalty.</p>
<p>Many commentators look back on pre-internet customer service as the good old days, with real people helping people and developing long-term relationships. The internet, the narrative goes, put up a wall between brands and customers, making digital customer service potentially faster, but far less personal. The solution to that conundrum certainly isn’t to stop using technology — <a href="http://www.brandembassy.com/blog/why-chatbots-will-not-replace-contact-centers"><b>chatbots</b></a><b> and digital customer care can be key differentiators</b>, because they allow brands to streamline and simplify customer service at scale.</p>
<p>But we’ve reached a tipping point, when everyone is starting to realize the importance of customer experience, and that brands need to step out from behind that digital wall. <b>83% of U.S. consumers prefer dealing with </b><a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/us-companies-losing-customers-as-consumers-demand-more-human-interaction-accenture-strategy-study-finds.htm"><b>human beings</b></a> over digital channels to solve customer services issues, according to new research from Accenture. It’s not that technology is suddenly useless. On the contrary, chatbots and advanced customer service technology are more important than ever before. In fact, the smartest brands will actually use automation to put the human back into the customer service equation.</p>
<h2><b>The beginning of a beautiful friendship</b></h2>
<p>We love technology and we’re big fans of innovation. Anything that could possibly help brands serve their customers better sounds fantastic to us. But technology alone can’t provide excellent customer service, because customers want personalized human connections. That’s why <b>52% of </b><a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/us-companies-losing-customers-as-consumers-demand-more-human-interaction-accenture-strategy-study-finds.htm"><b>consumers</b></a><b> have switched brands in the past year</b> due to poor customer service, which includes brands that made it difficult to get in touch with a human customer service agent. Bots are invaluable, especially when customers also have the opportunity to speak with an empathetic, responsive human.</p>
<p>Think of the popular stories you’ve heard about great customer service, from Zappos to Netflix or Hilton. It’s hard to imagine these being orchestrated by chatbots alone. But it’s also hard to imagine this extraordinary level of customer service being possible if agents didn’t have advanced technology at their fingertips.</p>
<p>The advantages of automation in customer service are too large to ignore. We have the technology, so why not use it? <b>The key is knowing when to use automation and when to rely on humans.</b> Doing so requires a clear-eyed consideration of what humans do best, and what should be left up to bots.</p>
<h2><b>What should be automated?</b></h2>
<p>Great customer service in the 21st century just isn’t possible without technology. Chatbots have all the advantages of computers: they’re fast and they’re rational. In the future, contact centers will take advantage of all that chatbots have to offer, but will only rely on them to do the things they’re best at, the 1st-level contacts for repetitive questions and issues that are easy to solve. There are exciting opportunities for brands who know how to make automation work for them.</p>
<p>As a basic bottom line, <b>all brands should offer proactive live chat.</b> Automated chatbots will seek out customers browsing the website and contact them based on what they are looking at. This kind of proactivity has positive effects on sales and customer satisfaction, but is often too much of a burden for human agents to take on, especially when there are many customers and a small team. Bots can free agents to do more important things.</p>
<p><b>Intelligent ticket routing is another vital feature</b> of automated customer service. Intelligent routing, particularly in <a href="http://www.brandembassy.com">digital customer service</a> where expectations for quick response and personalization are high, is a great way to utilize the best of both worlds. Brands have automation to select the best possible customer service agent, and a human touch to personalize the experience. It’s a question of using technology to lead customers to human agents if and when they need it.</p>
<h2><b>What needs a human touch? </b></h2>
<p>In the future, <a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/human-customer-service-still-valued-by-customers/">human agents</a> will focus on complex issues, and will use their emotional intelligence and instinct whenever they can. Essentially, technology will take care of the technical stuff, freeing up human agents to do what they do best. This will be a systematic change in the way we think about and execute digital customer service.</p>
<p>To cultivate the human touch in digital customer service, brands have to do three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recognize the importance of empathy</li>
<li>Make personal connections</li>
<li>Provide repeat contact points</li>
</ul>
<p><b>83% of </b><a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/us-companies-losing-customers-as-consumers-demand-more-human-interaction-accenture-strategy-study-finds.htm"><b>American customers</b></a><b> who have switched brands</b> say that better live or in-person customer service would have inspired them to stay. Customer service should be less about “satisfying” customers and more about moving them smoothly through the service experience time after time. But even earlier, before making a sale, chatbots can get in touch with the customer and guide them along. <b>Bots take care of the easily solvable problems, leading customers to qualified agents</b> who can then develop and sustain relationships with customers over time, which means increased loyalty and distinguishing customer experience.</p>
<p><b>It’s time we brought humans back into customer service, </b>but that doesn’t mean abandoning technology. Brands that achieve a balance between automation and human connections will succeed by utilizing the advantages of technology without neglecting age-old human contact.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This guest post is written by Erica Strother Marois, the Community Specialist at <a href="http://www.icmi.com">ICMI</a>. </em></p>
<p>We’ve all been on the receiving end of poor customer service. Long wait times, annoying IVRs, unforgiving return policies, and a lack of channel options can all be maddening. And inevitably, these frustrations spill over to the front line employees. Customer service is more complex and stressful than ever, and ICMI research indicates that <a href="http://www.icmi.com/Resources/Research/2015-Smarter-Service-for-the-Connected-Consumer">the industry</a> is only growing more complicated.</p>
<p>What can customer service leaders do to alleviate stress and improve the customer experience? To answer that, we turn to some of the most infamous customer service failures in recent history. (After all, some of the best insight comes from the biggest failures).</p>
<p><span id="more-7385"></span>Here are five lessons learned from headline-grabbing customer service failures:</p>
<h2><strong>1. Sometimes customers are wrong. Make it easier for them to be right.</strong></h2>
<p>“The customer is always right.” It’s a quote that business professionals have recited for years, but <em>is</em> the customer always right? Or is the customer ever to blame for poor service?</p>
<p>Remember the Maine Diner that kicked a customer out of her restaurant last summer? The customer’s child was disruptive, so she asked them to leave. Who was right? Plenty of people actually sided with the owner.</p>
<p>And remember this controversial <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matt-walsh/bad-customer-service_b_3799574.html">Huffington Post article from 2013</a>?</p>
<p>Honestly, the customer isn’t always right. But it’s our job to treat them like they are. And even more importantly, it’s our job to make it easier for them to be right.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2414 size-full" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/erica-blog-post-1.png" alt="customer service failures" width="542" height="191" /></p>
<p>Are your customers calling the wrong line for service? Perhaps your customers are angry about late fees imposed on their account? Think about what you could do to prevent the situation from ever taking place.  Could you improve your website? Could you send text reminders to let your customers know their bill due date is approaching? In the case of that Maine diner—should the owner offer snacks and coloring books for young children? Perhaps a kid-friendly seating section?</p>
<p>Sure—customers are wrong sometimes, but that shouldn’t change their experience, or your company’s approach to service.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Taking ownership doesn’t mean taking blame.</strong></h2>
<p>It’s human nature to be defensive. No one enjoys being wrong. Unfortunately, defensiveness doesn’t solve problems. When it comes to customer interactions, it’s essential to take ownership when situations don’t go as planned. This doesn’t always mean falling on the sword and taking all the blame, it means taking responsibility for making the situation right. It also means listening—<em>really listening</em>—to your customers and looking for the lesson in their feedback. Help your customers regain confidence in your company by taking control of the situation, making it right, and preventing future problems.</p>
<p>View feedback as a gift, not a burden.  Don’t discourage your customers from sharing how they feel, or offering their tips for improvement. And certainly never approach customer feedback the way <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/04/travel/bad-hotel-review-fine-backlash/">this hotel</a> did.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Customer service is a tough job.</strong></h2>
<p>Remember the <a href="https://www.thedijuliusgroup.com/blog/2014/taco-bell-employee-shoots-unhappy-customer-frontier-pilot-buys-pizzas-for-all-passengers/646/">fast food employee</a> who in a fit of frustration <em>shot</em> a customer? Thankfully the customer was okay, but how did the situation escalate to that point?</p>
<p>Dealing with angry customers isn’t pleasant or easy. And while it’s never acceptable for an agent or employee to behave unprofessionally, it’s important to acknowledge the challenging nature of customer interactions. It’s impossible to prevent a problem if you don’t admit it exists. Show your employees that you know how tough their job is, and take steps to alleviate some of the stress.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2415 size-full" src="http://onereach.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/erica-blog-post-2.png" alt="customer service failures" width="491" height="239" /></p>
<p>Offer on-site yoga classes. Dedicate a room for quiet meditation. Give your agents stress balls, or adult coloring books for breaks.</p>
<p>More importantly, arm your employees with the training and tools needed to tackle difficult situations. Consider difficult customer interactions as learning moments. Bring recordings or transcripts of heated exchanges to group training sessions, and ask team members how they’d respond in a similar situation.  Role play. Help agents prepare for the worst, and they’ll feel more comfortable and confident when a difficult call comes their way.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Don’t forget the human touch.</strong></h2>
<p>An expectation of 24/7 service, in a customer’s language and channel of choice is no longer uncommon. To meet these rising expectations, many companies have relied on automation to close the gap. While there are certainly instances when automation can be effective, remember that customer service is still a people business. Forgetting the human touch causes your company to feel unauthentic, and that can lead to less loyal customers. This is especially true in service channels such as social media that are supposed to be (you guessed it) <em>social</em>.</p>
<p>Case in point: a few months ago, a well-known telecommunications provider crashed ICMI’s weekly Twitter chat.  Awesome, right? Encouraging to witness a respected brand listening to their customers on social media, huh? Not exactly. It quickly became glaringly obvious that we were dealing with bots—and not the intelligent type.  You can read more about the entire exchange by checking out this <a href="http://www.toistersolutions.com/blog/2015/10/28/automation-fail-how-attcares-stumbled-into-a-tweet-chat">blog post by Jeff Toister</a>.  Spoiler alert: this company has become a running joke in the <a href="http://www.icmi.com/forums/forum1005-icmichat-forum.aspx">#ICMIchat community</a>, and serves as a prime example of how <em>not</em> to handle automated customer service.</p>
<h2><strong>5. Give your agents the freedom to make things right.</strong></h2>
<p>Just like scripts, policies can be used as a helpful guide for serving customers. Setting expectations makes the experience more positive for both customers and agents. But remember there are times when every rule must be broken.  Rigid policies can often make an employee’s job even harder, so it’s critical to empower your employees. Give them the freedom to exercise common sense and bend the rules when needed.</p>
<p>For example, imagine you work in a hotel. A distressed (and naked) customer shows up at the front desk. He’s been locked out of his room and needs help getting back in. You ask for his ID, but it’s in his room (which he’s locked out of). According to hotel policy, you’re only allowed to issue a new key to customers who are able to show photo identification. How would you handle this situation? This happened several months ago, and due to the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/video/naked-guy-gets-locked-hotel-150253974.html">strict hotel policy</a> the employee wasn’t able to help the guest in the best way possible.</p>
<p>Rules and guidelines are valuable, yes.  But teaching your employees how to determine when to break the rules is even more valuable. Don’t let policies leave your customers feeling like a number instead of a valued guest.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we look back on 2015, it’s tempting to refer to that age-old adage: “The more things change, the more things stay the same.”</p>
<p>This year, that couldn’t be further from the truth.</p>
<p>That’s because 2015 was the year the technology really made its presence known in customer service. Automation, artificial intelligence, social media, CRM integrations, texting&#8211;all were major customer service trends in 2015.</p>
<h2><span id="more-7370"></span><strong>Customer Service Trends in 2015</strong></h2>
<p>2015 was the year that:</p>
<p><strong>Customer service got smart.</strong> This year, artificial intelligence wasn’t just limited to the realms of science fiction a la Age of Ultron—it was also slowly incorporated into different companies’ service offerings. Amazon made its entry into the home automation market with Alexa, a virtual assistant that can field questions ranging from the time of day to traffic predictions to good restaurants nearby. On the enterprise-level side, IBM continued to expand the capabilities of Jeopardy-winning Watson, adding self-service into varied industries like healthcare, education and finance, among others.</p>
<p><strong>Customer service got automated.</strong> Over <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">55% of customers</a> would like a self-service experience, which provides businesses with the unique opportunity to speed up the customer experience while decreasing costs. In the restaurant industry, established chains like Outback Steakhouse and Olive Garden let customers <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Saving-Money/2015/0514/Restaurant-table-tablets-A-gimmick-or-actually-helpful" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">order via tablets</a>, while market newcomer <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/09/upshot/restaurant-of-the-future-service-with-an-impersonal-touch.html?_r=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eatsa</a> automated the bulk of the food delivery process. Automated self-service also extended to digital channels—companies like <a href="http://www.toistersolutions.com/blog/2015/10/28/automation-fail-how-attcares-stumbled-into-a-tweet-chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AT&amp;T</a> automated social media responses (not always with the best outcome), while <a href="https://www.twilio.com/customers/stories/uber" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uber</a>, Snooze and more texted customers about the status of their ride or table.</p>
<p><strong>Customer service got focused.</strong> Over 80% of companies want to use <a href="https://fonolo.com/blog/2013/09/17-important-customer-experience-statistics-for-the-call-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customer service</a> as a way to differentiate themselves from their competition. But what defines a good customer service experience? In 2015, we interviewed over 60 industry influencers and found that the best way to <a href="http://onereach.com/resources/customer-service-report-2015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improve customer service</a> was to focus on the employee experience. By focusing on employees and treating them with respect, companies can ensure that they pass that goodwill onto customers. Case in point: <a href="https://jobs.zappos.com/why-zappos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zappos</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/about/careers/lifeatgoogle/benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Customer service got diversified.</strong> In 2015, companies made an effort to diversify their service offerings, providing support on established and emerging channels.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mobile.</strong> In 2015, companies increasingly relied on mobile to interact with their customers. This year saw the official launch of Apple Pay, Starbucks’ continued success with mobile app <a href="http://www.nfcworld.com/2015/07/24/336798/one-in-five-starbucks-sales-in-the-us-made-with-mobile-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">payments</a> (more than $9 million in orders processed per week) and Magic’s simple but powerful text concierge service. As mentioned above, more and more companies saw the value of adding texting to their support strategy, making it easier for customers to contact them on a channel they prefer. However, not every attempt to implement mobile customer service was successful—Domino’s unfortunately disappointed some customers with the rollout of its text-to-order service.</p>
<p><strong>Video.</strong> Audiovisual communication has been popular among consumers for years, but 2015 was the year when video really started to gain a foothold in B2C interactions. Amazon’s Mayday is probably the most well-known example, but <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/28/this-is-webrtcs-yearor-is-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Express</a> and other companies helped customers solve their problems over video. WebRTC’s open source nature also made it easier for any company to incorporate video into their service offering.</p>
<p><strong>Social.</strong> 2015 was the year social platforms got serious about customer service interactions. <a href="https://twitter.app.box.com/customer-service-on-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>released a customer service playbook outlining the benefits of using social for customer service, as well as how to apply it to an organization. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/15/facebook-pages-can-now-show-how-quickly-they-respond-to-customers-messages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> also launched a new feature that keeps track of how long it takes company pages to respond to customer messages, giving customers better insight into the responsiveness of an organization. This is especially important, given the fact that over 40% of customers expect a response on <a href="http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-research/42-percent-of-consumers-complaining-in-social-media-expect-60-minute-response-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social</a> in 60 minutes or less.</p>
<p><strong>Voice.</strong> Voice is still king in contact center service interactions, but times are changing. Research from<a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dimension Data</a> found that while voice accounts for 65% of all contact center interactions, digital interactions will surpass voice by the end of 2017. And with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/07/technology/tech-companies-leave-phone-calls-behind.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet-based companies</a> making a concerted attempt to direct customers towards digital, with other companies ditching corporate <a href="http://www.inc.com/associated-press/jpmorgan-chase-getting-rid-of-voicemail-for-some-employees.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">voicemail</a>, it became very clear in that businesses couldn’t just rely on voice for communication.</p>
<p><strong>Web chat</strong>. Over 70% of contact centers will offer web chat by the end of 2016, up from just 33% in 2015. There are several reasons why companies would want to invest in web chat—it’s cheaper than voice, agents can handle multiple conversations at once and respond in real-time, etc. And there’s a reason companies from Nordstrom to Nike are using web chat to interact with customers—while 91% of customers are happy with web chat’s ability to solve customer support issues, 62% of customers are more inclined to buy a product if live chat is available.</p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>Looking ahead to 2016</strong></h2>
<p>2015 was an exciting year for customer service, with lots of progress made in digital interactions and automation. 2016 is set to be an equally exciting year, if not more so, as companies continue to build on the advances made in 2015. We can’t say for sure what will happen in customer service in 2016, but we’ve got a few ideas.</p>
<p>Below are our customer service predictions for 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Continued rise in cloud computing</strong>. In 2016, businesses will continue to migrate to the <a href="http://www.icmi.com/Resources/Technology/2014/05/Is-the-Cloud-Contact-Center-Passing-You-By" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloud</a> for its accessibility, storage, simplicity, and security, among other benefits. In fact, 88% of businesses are currently using the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2015/03/04/new-stats-from-the-state-of-cloud-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public cloud</a>. In addition, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2015/09/27/roundup-of-cloud-computing-forecasts-and-market-estimates-q3-update-2015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner</a> predicts that by 2020, roughly 25% of organizations will use cloud-based CRMs. Cloud-based software-as-a-service, or <a href="http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/technology/publications/global-software-100-leaders/saas-trends.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SaaS</a>, will also become more prevalent, growing at a rate of 21.3% per year and making up 14.2% of software spending. <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/273642/worldwide-software-as-a-service-revenue-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SaaS revenue</a> is predicted to hit $32.8 billion in revenue in 2016, up 17% from 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Delivering on the omnichannel promise. </strong>In 2013, <a href="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zendesk </a>research found that over 85% of customers thought companies needed to do a better job of providing a seamless experience. In 2015, companies were on the right track but weren’t quite there yet—nearly 50% of contact centers named integration of Web, contact center and CRM systems as their top challenge, with <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">integration</a> of systems to enable channel hopping close behind (41%). We predict that in 2016, companies will continue to take steps toward providing an omnichannel experience. Companies will find and use service platforms that manage and can integrate with multiple service channels/CRMs and similar systems.</p>
<p><strong>Personalization.</strong> This trend is a combination of the previous two trends—cloud services will enable companies to provide a personalized experience across channels. We predict that the ability to integrate customer data into service interactions will become increasingly mainstream in 2016, both in response to <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/07/14/consumers-want-privacy-yet-demand-personalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consumer demand</a> and a desire to differentiate on great <a href="https://fonolo.com/blog/2013/09/17-important-customer-experience-statistics-for-the-call-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customer experiences</a>. The SaaS pricing model of most cloud services will also make it easy for businesses of any size to provide great customer service.</p>
<p><strong>Proactive customer service.</strong> <a href="http://www.wired.com/insights/2014/11/the-internet-of-things-bigger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Internet of Things</a> is rapidly changing our personal and professional lives. IoT-based companies, but other businesses as well, will leverage customer data to provide a proactive service experience. Although IoT is primarily focused on the B2C experience (think FitBit or any smartfridge), other organizations can learn from IoT innovations. Take, for example, the proactive service experience industry pundits anticipate will take shape in the IoT industry: <a href="http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Web-Exclusives/Viewpoints/Revolutionizing-Customer-Service-with-the-Internet-of-Things-105722.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner</a> predicts that by 2018, five percent of IoT devices will automatically trigger service cases.</p>
<p><strong>More artificial intelligence.</strong> In 2016, AI will continue to get smarter, and its presence in business will continue to grow. This is evidenced by the amount of <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/artificial-intelligence-in-business-the-state-of-play-and-future-prospects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">venture capital</a> being put toward AI-centered businesses, which grew from $75 million in 2013 to $300 million in 2014. And while <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/artificial-intelligence-in-business-the-state-of-play-and-future-prospects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artificial intelligence</a> is primarily being used for voice recognition and response, <a href="http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Editorial/Magazine-Features/The-2015-CRM-Rising-Stars-IBMs-Watson-Brings-Cognitive-Computing-to-Customer-Support-102108.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner</a> predicts that 10% of computers will be able to learn from past interactions by 2017. At OneReach, we’re helping to make this possible through the use of AI in IVRs or self-service.</p>
<p><strong>Moving towards a mobile-first future.</strong> Our world is becoming increasingly mobilized—nearly two billion global citizens now own a <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/2-Billion-Consumers-Worldwide-Smartphones-by-2016/1011694" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smartphone</a>. This mobile change extends to customer service, where 62% of companies think <a href="http://www.icmi.com/About-ICMI/Press-Room/2013-Mobile-Customer-Service-Strategy-Results-Released" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobile service</a> is a competitive differentiator and 64% of customers would prefer to text customer service. Texting is poised to make a big gain in the customer service field, with more than 60% of <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact centers</a>offering it by 2017. In 2016, we predict that companies will continue to provide customer service on mobile devices, whether it’s via text message, mobile applications, mobile websites, or other channels.</p>
<p><strong>More digital/emerging channels.</strong> As mentioned above, customer service interactions will shift to focus on emerging digital channels, both in response to consumer preference and cost savings. Take, for instance, the increased use emerging channels: One in four contact centers will offer <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> by the end of 2017, one in two contact centers will offer a smartphone app by the end of 2017, and three out of five contact centers will offer texting/IM by the end of 2017.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>2015 was a big year for customer service, and 2016 is set to be an even bigger one. We predict that new applications of technology like artificial intelligence and automation will define customer service in the coming years, as they already have today. Companies and contact centers that embrace the customer service trends in 2015 and beyond are poised to make an impact on the market that will be felt for years to come.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The city of Evanston, Ill. has worked with OneReach to provide residents with the ability to check the health inspection scores of local restaurants over text.</p>
<p><span id="more-7369"></span>Diners can text the keyword &#8220;food&#8221; to the city&#8217;s 311 number, and then text the name of the restaurant to see the health inspection score, as well as the date the inspection took place.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.govtech.com/health/Texting-Helps-in-Fight-Against-Foodborne-Illnesses-in-Evanston-Ill.html">Government Technology</a> points out that the use of texting makes getting restaurant scores a lot easier for consumers:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s simple and much easier than Yelp’s mobile app, which compels users to tap and swipe their way to a restaurant’s “More Info” tab and deep dive through a list of miscellaneous information.</p></blockquote>
<p>The food safety text initiative follows the city&#8217;s initiative to local restaurant inspection scores onto Yelp.</p>

In fact, Facebook has even create an app specifically devoted to</span><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/04/media/facebook-news-notifications-app/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">notifications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the New York Times has an 11-person team dedicated to</span><a href="http://digiday.com/publishers/inside-new-york-times-new-push-notifications-team/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">push notifications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easy to see why people like push notifications. They’re controlled by the user (they can turn them or of), there’s a deep link to the application so you don’t have to go searching through it, and it’s not limited by characters like other messages. In addition, push notifications aren’t highly regulated (for better or worse) and don’t cost anything to receive them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while there’s nothing quite like the thrill of receiving a new notification, push notifications aren’t always the best way to engage with customers. In fact, some consumers are turning them off.</span></p>
<h2><span id="more-7365"></span><b>When Push Notifications Become Too Much  </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For all of push notifications’ popularity, these notifications can sometimes get too, well, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">pushy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Millennials noted they’re turned off by</span><a href="http://www.dmnews.com/marketing-strategy/84-percent-of-millennials-act-on-push-notifications/article/448580/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">notifications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that are too intrusive (34%), too often (25%) or poorly timed (11%). Organizations have also gotten called out for sending users</span><a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/02/06/prevent-app-getting-pushy-push-notifications/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">irrelevant updates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Y&#8217;all really think this deserves a push notification? <a href="https://t.co/4sSLNJ8xFW">pic.twitter.com/4sSLNJ8xFW</a></p>
<p>— Nick Morrow (@NRMorrow) <a href="https://twitter.com/NRMorrow/status/663882868846960640">November 10, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And push notification opt-in rates aren’t necessarily as good as they look. Android has a 78% opt-in rate compared to iOS’ 46%, but part of this is because Android users are</span><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150630005780/en/Kahuna-Mobile-Marketing-Index-90-App-Users"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">automatically opted-in</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150630005780/en/Kahuna-Mobile-Marketing-Index-90-App-Users"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Opt-in rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are also dramatically different across verticals, where they’re as high as 78% for travel and transportation, and as low as 35% for medical, health and fitness. If you’re developing an app in one of the lower-performing categories, you’re going to have a tough time engaging customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, when it comes to people actually interacting with these notifications, the chance they are is relatively low—</span><a href="http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/accengage-six-percent-of-users-respond-to-push-notifications-infographic/615791"><span style="font-weight: 400;">just six percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And interacting with the notification also takes a lot of effort: you have to click, go into the app, then perform the action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But let’s take a look at the app that’s sending the push notifications. It can cost a fortune to develop </span><a href="http://resources.kinvey.com/docs/State+of+Enterprise+Mobility+Survey+2014+-+Kinvey.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a mobile app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it’s only going to be accessible on smartphones, not feature phones. While a good portion of Americans own </span><a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/chapter-one-a-portrait-of-smartphone-ownership/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">smartphones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (64%), you’re still missing out on over a third of cell phone users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, you have a choice on how to notify customers, and it’s not just limited to push notifications. You can do it all through the most-used app on a smartphone: text messaging. In fact, Pew Research has found that texting even trumps social media use as the most common daily smartphone activity. </span></p>

<h2><b>Text Messages vs Push Notifications</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While texts and push notifications are similar insofar as they’re controlled by the user (with text, it’s an opt-in/opt-out program) and that there’s a deep link to the application (assuming the app has been downloaded already), the similarities end there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s because the purpose of push notifications is to do one thing—notify. It doesn’t require any further action, for better and for worse. It’s a one-way communication channel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to make sure customers are getting (and interacting with) your message, there’s no better channel than text. Text has a</span><a href="http://mobilemarketingwatch.com/sms-marketing-wallops-email-with-98-open-rate-and-only-1-spam-43866/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">98% open rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a</span><a href="https://www.marketingtechblog.com/text-messaging/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">45% response rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, trumping push notifications’ read rate of just six percent. Text transforms one-way reminders into two-way notifications, like an appointment reminder that can be rescheduled via SMS, or a restaurant deal that asks the first 100 users to text back to redeem it. Text can also be used for number verification, two-factor authentication, and a variety of other use cases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike push notifications, text also doesn’t require an Internet connection to function or an app to be downloaded—in fact, it’s a great way to </span><a href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/voice-text-can-increase-mobile-app-downloads/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drive app downloads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And instead of just staying automated, texts can also be routed to a live agent for further interaction if a customer really needs help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One company using text notifications to great effect is Snooze. They’re an extremely popular breakfast eatery that almost always has a wait time due to the sheer amount of customers that visits them. To get around this, Snooze asks patrons for their telephone number, then sends them a text when their table is ready. This way, users can enjoy the freedom of walking through the shopping center around Snooze without having to tote around a buzzer. The “table ready” notifications are delivered directly to their phone.</span></p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Text messaging and push notifications are both great ways to notify consumers, but only text messaging can turn a notification into a conversation. There is certainly a time and place for both, so keep your desired outcome in mind as you activate your notification strategy.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With <em>Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens</em> set to debut in just a few days’ time, we couldn’t be more excited. The decades-old space saga is sure to send us on a new, fantastical adventure, complete with lessons on friendship, family and the Force (and of course, lightsaber duels).</p>
<p>In the midst of all this excitement, we realized that there were a few things we could learn from Star Wars about customer service. So now, we’re bringing insights from a galaxy far, far away a little closer to home.</p>
<h2><span id="more-7364"></span><strong>“Do. Or do not. There is no try.” – Yoda</strong></h2>
<p>Yoda gives Luke this advice when he’s training in the swampland of Dagobah, but you don’t need to be in a galaxy far, far away to learn from these insights. That’s because in customer service, your job is to do, and do not. Do whatever is in your power to solve the customer’s problem. Don’t leave them with a bad experience. You can’t just attempt to do something, you need to follow through and be consistent. Then be able to provide good customer service you will.</p>
<h2><strong>“Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi, you’re my only hope.” – Princess Leia</strong></h2>
<p>When a customer comes to you, they may have tried using a variety of different channels to get help and might be at their breaking point. They really are counting on you to help solve their problems. In fact, a <a href="http://cdn.zendesk.com/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf">Zendesk</a> study found that 88% of customers said problem resolution was important to them (89% said speed of resolution was important as well). Take a look at past customer interactions to help inform your current interaction, increasingly the likelihood that you’ll be able to solve their problem, or at least direct them to a person who can.</p>
<h2><strong>“Great, kid. Don’t get cocky.” – Han Solo</strong></h2>
<p>Being able to solve a customer’s problem quickly and effectively is a wonderful feeling. However, one good experience doesn’t define them all. As customer service Jedi <a href="http://hyken.com/customer-loyalty/customer-service-tool-consistency/">Shep Hyken</a> states, you need to provide a consistently great experience: “Confidence comes when the customer knows what to expect, and gets it every time.” One great experience can help build the foundation of a great relationship between company and customer, but only consistency can ensure that that bond stays strong.</p>
<h2><strong>“I find your lack of faith disturbing.” – Darth Vader</strong></h2>
<p>Customers have lost faith in customer service agents’ ability to help them—just look at the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/15/5901057/comcast-call-cancel-service-ryan-block">Comcast cancellation call</a> and the fallout that followed. Perhaps this is because customer expectations are pretty high. Research has found that over <a href="http://www.parature.com/2013-customer-expectations/">60% of customers</a> expect agents to be more knowledgeable, and 37% expect to be able to contact the same <a href="http://cdn.zendesk.com/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf">service representative</a> regardless of the channel they use. But don’t lose faith—most customer service agents do a great job of meeting customer needs. In fact, in response to a demand for omnichannel customer service, 35% of agents are now multiskilled across various communication.</p>
<h2><strong>“These aren’t the droids you’re looking for.” – Obi-Wan Kenobi</strong></h2>
<p>In customer service, it can be easy to get distracted and solely rely on metrics to gauge your performance: CSAT, NPS, etc. However, while these numbers are a good benchmark, each interaction is unique and deserves to be treated as such. The average handle time might be under three minutes, but if a customer will need more help than can fit into that timeframe, you have to set the numbers aside for a moment and recognize that good service can’t always be quantified.</p>
<h2><strong>“You have that power too. In time you&#8217;ll learn to use it as I have.” – Luke Skywalker</strong></h2>
<p>Just as a padawan needs training before he’s ready to become a Jedi, so do customer service agents need training to provide great service to customers. Over 30% of agents think training would increase their <a href="http://2020workforce.com/2014/12/08/what-benefits-increase-employee-loyalty-and-engagement/">engagement</a> and loyalty. In addition, 29% of employees believe the ability to learn and get <a href="http://blog.accessdevelopment.com/index.php/2014/08/employee-engagement-loyalty-statistics-the-ultimate-collection">trained quickly</a> is an attribute that is important to their employer. By taking time to focus on the employee experience and develop their skills, companies can empower agents to empower customers through regular training, one-on-one support sessions and more. It’s a win-win!</p>
<h2><strong>“Judge me by my size, do you?” – Yoda</strong></h2>
<p>With the rise of cloud-based products and SaaS model pricing, companies of any size can now provide great customer service. For small, growing companies, establishing a close working relationship and providing great service is crucial, as that will be how you maintain and grow your customer base. For bigger companies with a larger customer base, it’s still important that you don’t let great customer service fall by the wayside. Even if you’re dealing with a high volume of customers and working against preset metrics, make sure each interaction still has that human touch.</p>
<h2><strong>“No, I am your father.” – Darth Vader </strong></h2>
<p>You didn’t think we wouldn’t include this one, did you? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
