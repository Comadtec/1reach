								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we look back on 2015, it’s tempting to refer to that age-old adage: “The more things change, the more things stay the same.”</p>
<p>This year, that couldn’t be further from the truth.</p>
<p>That’s because 2015 was the year the technology really made its presence known in customer service. Automation, artificial intelligence, social media, CRM integrations, texting&#8211;all were major customer service trends in 2015.</p>
<h2><span id="more-7370"></span><strong>Customer Service Trends in 2015</strong></h2>
<p>2015 was the year that:</p>
<p><strong>Customer service got smart.</strong> This year, artificial intelligence wasn’t just limited to the realms of science fiction a la Age of Ultron—it was also slowly incorporated into different companies’ service offerings. Amazon made its entry into the home automation market with Alexa, a virtual assistant that can field questions ranging from the time of day to traffic predictions to good restaurants nearby. On the enterprise-level side, IBM continued to expand the capabilities of Jeopardy-winning Watson, adding self-service into varied industries like healthcare, education and finance, among others.</p>
<p><strong>Customer service got automated.</strong> Over <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">55% of customers</a> would like a self-service experience, which provides businesses with the unique opportunity to speed up the customer experience while decreasing costs. In the restaurant industry, established chains like Outback Steakhouse and Olive Garden let customers <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Saving-Money/2015/0514/Restaurant-table-tablets-A-gimmick-or-actually-helpful" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">order via tablets</a>, while market newcomer <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/09/upshot/restaurant-of-the-future-service-with-an-impersonal-touch.html?_r=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eatsa</a> automated the bulk of the food delivery process. Automated self-service also extended to digital channels—companies like <a href="http://www.toistersolutions.com/blog/2015/10/28/automation-fail-how-attcares-stumbled-into-a-tweet-chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AT&amp;T</a> automated social media responses (not always with the best outcome), while <a href="https://www.twilio.com/customers/stories/uber" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uber</a>, Snooze and more texted customers about the status of their ride or table.</p>
<p><strong>Customer service got focused.</strong> Over 80% of companies want to use <a href="https://fonolo.com/blog/2013/09/17-important-customer-experience-statistics-for-the-call-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customer service</a> as a way to differentiate themselves from their competition. But what defines a good customer service experience? In 2015, we interviewed over 60 industry influencers and found that the best way to <a href="http://onereach.com/resources/customer-service-report-2015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improve customer service</a> was to focus on the employee experience. By focusing on employees and treating them with respect, companies can ensure that they pass that goodwill onto customers. Case in point: <a href="https://jobs.zappos.com/why-zappos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zappos</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/about/careers/lifeatgoogle/benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Customer service got diversified.</strong> In 2015, companies made an effort to diversify their service offerings, providing support on established and emerging channels.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mobile.</strong> In 2015, companies increasingly relied on mobile to interact with their customers. This year saw the official launch of Apple Pay, Starbucks’ continued success with mobile app <a href="http://www.nfcworld.com/2015/07/24/336798/one-in-five-starbucks-sales-in-the-us-made-with-mobile-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">payments</a> (more than $9 million in orders processed per week) and Magic’s simple but powerful text concierge service. As mentioned above, more and more companies saw the value of adding texting to their support strategy, making it easier for customers to contact them on a channel they prefer. However, not every attempt to implement mobile customer service was successful—Domino’s unfortunately disappointed some customers with the rollout of its text-to-order service.</p>
<p><strong>Video.</strong> Audiovisual communication has been popular among consumers for years, but 2015 was the year when video really started to gain a foothold in B2C interactions. Amazon’s Mayday is probably the most well-known example, but <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/28/this-is-webrtcs-yearor-is-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Express</a> and other companies helped customers solve their problems over video. WebRTC’s open source nature also made it easier for any company to incorporate video into their service offering.</p>
<p><strong>Social.</strong> 2015 was the year social platforms got serious about customer service interactions. <a href="https://twitter.app.box.com/customer-service-on-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>released a customer service playbook outlining the benefits of using social for customer service, as well as how to apply it to an organization. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/15/facebook-pages-can-now-show-how-quickly-they-respond-to-customers-messages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> also launched a new feature that keeps track of how long it takes company pages to respond to customer messages, giving customers better insight into the responsiveness of an organization. This is especially important, given the fact that over 40% of customers expect a response on <a href="http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-research/42-percent-of-consumers-complaining-in-social-media-expect-60-minute-response-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social</a> in 60 minutes or less.</p>
<p><strong>Voice.</strong> Voice is still king in contact center service interactions, but times are changing. Research from<a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dimension Data</a> found that while voice accounts for 65% of all contact center interactions, digital interactions will surpass voice by the end of 2017. And with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/07/technology/tech-companies-leave-phone-calls-behind.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet-based companies</a> making a concerted attempt to direct customers towards digital, with other companies ditching corporate <a href="http://www.inc.com/associated-press/jpmorgan-chase-getting-rid-of-voicemail-for-some-employees.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">voicemail</a>, it became very clear in that businesses couldn’t just rely on voice for communication.</p>
<p><strong>Web chat</strong>. Over 70% of contact centers will offer web chat by the end of 2016, up from just 33% in 2015. There are several reasons why companies would want to invest in web chat—it’s cheaper than voice, agents can handle multiple conversations at once and respond in real-time, etc. And there’s a reason companies from Nordstrom to Nike are using web chat to interact with customers—while 91% of customers are happy with web chat’s ability to solve customer support issues, 62% of customers are more inclined to buy a product if live chat is available.</p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>Looking ahead to 2016</strong></h2>
<p>2015 was an exciting year for customer service, with lots of progress made in digital interactions and automation. 2016 is set to be an equally exciting year, if not more so, as companies continue to build on the advances made in 2015. We can’t say for sure what will happen in customer service in 2016, but we’ve got a few ideas.</p>
<p>Below are our customer service predictions for 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Continued rise in cloud computing</strong>. In 2016, businesses will continue to migrate to the <a href="http://www.icmi.com/Resources/Technology/2014/05/Is-the-Cloud-Contact-Center-Passing-You-By" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloud</a> for its accessibility, storage, simplicity, and security, among other benefits. In fact, 88% of businesses are currently using the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2015/03/04/new-stats-from-the-state-of-cloud-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public cloud</a>. In addition, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2015/09/27/roundup-of-cloud-computing-forecasts-and-market-estimates-q3-update-2015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner</a> predicts that by 2020, roughly 25% of organizations will use cloud-based CRMs. Cloud-based software-as-a-service, or <a href="http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/technology/publications/global-software-100-leaders/saas-trends.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SaaS</a>, will also become more prevalent, growing at a rate of 21.3% per year and making up 14.2% of software spending. <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/273642/worldwide-software-as-a-service-revenue-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SaaS revenue</a> is predicted to hit $32.8 billion in revenue in 2016, up 17% from 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Delivering on the omnichannel promise. </strong>In 2013, <a href="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zendesk </a>research found that over 85% of customers thought companies needed to do a better job of providing a seamless experience. In 2015, companies were on the right track but weren’t quite there yet—nearly 50% of contact centers named integration of Web, contact center and CRM systems as their top challenge, with <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">integration</a> of systems to enable channel hopping close behind (41%). We predict that in 2016, companies will continue to take steps toward providing an omnichannel experience. Companies will find and use service platforms that manage and can integrate with multiple service channels/CRMs and similar systems.</p>
<p><strong>Personalization.</strong> This trend is a combination of the previous two trends—cloud services will enable companies to provide a personalized experience across channels. We predict that the ability to integrate customer data into service interactions will become increasingly mainstream in 2016, both in response to <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/07/14/consumers-want-privacy-yet-demand-personalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consumer demand</a> and a desire to differentiate on great <a href="https://fonolo.com/blog/2013/09/17-important-customer-experience-statistics-for-the-call-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customer experiences</a>. The SaaS pricing model of most cloud services will also make it easy for businesses of any size to provide great customer service.</p>
<p><strong>Proactive customer service.</strong> <a href="http://www.wired.com/insights/2014/11/the-internet-of-things-bigger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Internet of Things</a> is rapidly changing our personal and professional lives. IoT-based companies, but other businesses as well, will leverage customer data to provide a proactive service experience. Although IoT is primarily focused on the B2C experience (think FitBit or any smartfridge), other organizations can learn from IoT innovations. Take, for example, the proactive service experience industry pundits anticipate will take shape in the IoT industry: <a href="http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Web-Exclusives/Viewpoints/Revolutionizing-Customer-Service-with-the-Internet-of-Things-105722.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner</a> predicts that by 2018, five percent of IoT devices will automatically trigger service cases.</p>
<p><strong>More artificial intelligence.</strong> In 2016, AI will continue to get smarter, and its presence in business will continue to grow. This is evidenced by the amount of <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/artificial-intelligence-in-business-the-state-of-play-and-future-prospects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">venture capital</a> being put toward AI-centered businesses, which grew from $75 million in 2013 to $300 million in 2014. And while <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/artificial-intelligence-in-business-the-state-of-play-and-future-prospects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artificial intelligence</a> is primarily being used for voice recognition and response, <a href="http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Editorial/Magazine-Features/The-2015-CRM-Rising-Stars-IBMs-Watson-Brings-Cognitive-Computing-to-Customer-Support-102108.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner</a> predicts that 10% of computers will be able to learn from past interactions by 2017. At OneReach, we’re helping to make this possible through the use of AI in IVRs or self-service.</p>
<p><strong>Moving towards a mobile-first future.</strong> Our world is becoming increasingly mobilized—nearly two billion global citizens now own a <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/2-Billion-Consumers-Worldwide-Smartphones-by-2016/1011694" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smartphone</a>. This mobile change extends to customer service, where 62% of companies think <a href="http://www.icmi.com/About-ICMI/Press-Room/2013-Mobile-Customer-Service-Strategy-Results-Released" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobile service</a> is a competitive differentiator and 64% of customers would prefer to text customer service. Texting is poised to make a big gain in the customer service field, with more than 60% of <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact centers</a>offering it by 2017. In 2016, we predict that companies will continue to provide customer service on mobile devices, whether it’s via text message, mobile applications, mobile websites, or other channels.</p>
<p><strong>More digital/emerging channels.</strong> As mentioned above, customer service interactions will shift to focus on emerging digital channels, both in response to consumer preference and cost savings. Take, for instance, the increased use emerging channels: One in four contact centers will offer <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> by the end of 2017, one in two contact centers will offer a smartphone app by the end of 2017, and three out of five contact centers will offer texting/IM by the end of 2017.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>2015 was a big year for customer service, and 2016 is set to be an even bigger one. We predict that new applications of technology like artificial intelligence and automation will define customer service in the coming years, as they already have today. Companies and contact centers that embrace the customer service trends in 2015 and beyond are poised to make an impact on the market that will be felt for years to come.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post originally appeared on <a href="http://www.icmi.com/Resources/Mobile/2015/12/8-Reasons-Why-Contact-Centers-Should-Offer-Texting">ICMI</a>.</em></p>
<p>The use of digital channels for customer service is on the rise. Recent research by <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dimension Data</a> found that over 35% of contact center interactions are now digital, not voice-based. In fact, digital interactions in the contact center will surpass voice interactions in two years’ time.</p>
<p>Text messaging is one of the digital channels contributing to that increase. According to the same Dimension Data report, nearly 40% of contact centers use text messaging/instant messaging, with this number set to increase to over 60% by 2017. The research also found that more interactions are handled via text messaging/instant messaging than on smartphone applications or social media.</p>
<p><span id="more-7367"></span>The prevalence of text messaging in the contact center means it is channel businesses can no longer afford to ignore. It allows agents to interact with customers on a channel they frequently use and prefer to use. In addition, text interactions can be managed through automation for lowered costs, or through live agent conversations via texting.</p>
<p><strong>Below are eight reasons why contact centers should start offering texting.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>1. Texting can be managed from the same platform as web chat for omnichannel capability.</strong></h2>
<p>The aforementioned <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dimension Data report</a> found that agents use two to three different software systems to manage voice interactions, and the same number to manage non-voice interactions. In addition, contact centers said that establishing a single platform for omnichannel capability was one of their top 3 technology priorities. Luckily, texting can be managed from the same platform as web chat and voice, and agents can switch between channels seamlessly in the right platform.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Agents can manage multiple conversations at once.</strong></h2>
<p>If there’s one universal truth about customers, it’s that they hate to wait. <a href="http://www.parature.com/2013-customer-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Over 75% of customers</a> expect customer service to be faster, and 90% are frustrated by being placed on hold for a long time. But with texting, as with web chat, agents can manage multiple conversations at once, decreasing average hold time In fact,<a href="https://blog.zopim.com/2014/11/13/infographic-theres-a-chat-for-that/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">42% of customers</a> say chat’s primary benefit is that it’s readily available. Managing multiple conversations at once can also satisfy customers—<a href="https://blog.zopim.com/2014/11/13/infographic-theres-a-chat-for-that/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">91% of customers</a> who have used live chat are satisfied with its ability to solve customer service inquiries.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Texting can integrate with your CRM or other data source.</strong></h2>
<p>Customer service conversations don’t exist in a vacuum—they’re informed by data to help agents better understand the customer, their background, and their current problem. Unfortunately, contact centers list integration of web, contact center and <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CRM technology</a> as their primary multichannel hurdle. Contact centers can surmount this obstacle by finding a texting solution that integrates with their existing CRM, ticketing system, or other data source. Luckily, with most cloud communication platforms today offering integration, this shouldn’t be a problem or require extra work.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Texting is cost-effective.</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/analystreports/enterprise-application/forrester-tei-atg-359304.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Forrester study</a> found that the average cost of a customer service phone call ranges anywhere between $6 and $25, or an average of $15.50 per interaction. Text chat, by comparison, is significantly less expensive, ranging <a href="http://www.providesupport.com/about-us/articles/live-chat-increases-satisfaction.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">between $1 to $5 per session</a>. Costs can also be lowered significantly (down to 25 cents) with automation. Some of our customers have seen a call deflection rate of 40% by pivoting customers to text, significantly decreasing the cost per interaction.</p>
<h2><strong>5. Texting can be partially automated for further cost savings (and for a smarter, faster user experience).</strong></h2>
<p>Texting, much like IVRs, can intelligently route callers to a certain person or department. Setting up a series of automated questions to answer before the customer is transferred to a live agent can give agents a better understanding of what the customer’s problem is and help move the interaction along. It also saves customers from having to repeat the same routine questions over and over. In addition, agents aren’t always going to be available, so it’s important to set up some form of automated response to catch customer inquiries that might come in during off hours.</p>
<p>Texting can take advantage of automation throughout the conversation and can even engage the use of multiple channels at once for more complex needs. For example, American Express fraud prevention asks customers what kind of phone they have when they call in. If customers have a smartphone, they receive a text with a link to a webpage where they can check their transactions for signs of fraud. The best part is that they’re already signed in because the system knows the phone number is associated with their account.</p>
<h2><strong>6. Texting merges mobile and online chat.</strong></h2>
<p>Texting blends the real-time answers of web chat with the portability of a mobile device. This means customers can interact with an agent from wherever they are, even in places where the customer may not have an internet connection. The agent and the customer are also able to seamlessly switch from web chat to texting without losing their connection, even if they have to continue the conversation on the go or if the customer has to run to a meeting. In addition, the customer can continue to multitask without having to start over another time. From an agent perspective, texting lets them use a web chat interface they’re familiar with, meaning they don’t have to relearn how to use it.</p>
<h2><strong>7. Texting is a channel customers want to use.</strong></h2>
<p>You may about know the high amount of usage of text messaging (97% of U.S. smartphone users use texting at least once a day), but you may not be aware that people want to texting with your contact center as well. A<a href="http://onereach.com/resources/high-demand-for-text-message-2014-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2014 study</a> conducted by Harris Poll and commissioned by OneReach found that 64% of customers want to text your business, and 44% of customers would prefer to texting with a live agent immediately rather than wait on hold. In addition, 23% of customers are likely to be loyal to a company that offers SMS.</p>
<h2><strong>8. Texting can handle a variety of use cases.</strong></h2>
<p>Most contact centers have a single use case that drives a large percentage of communication activity (ie password resets, status of order, etc). Many times this can be resolved better in a written channel (web or text) vs. voice, but could also be automated so you aren’t paying a live agent or the cost of the call to answer simple questions. For example, OneReach has worked with multiple companies where a password reset or a order status request make up close to or just over 50% of their call volume. Automating that answer or allowing the customer to self-serve quickly, without the need for a live agent, have drastic impacts on cost cutting measures as well as overall customer satisfaction. And in case it’s not as simple of an answer as they originally expected, SMS supports the ability to pivot back to a live agent for further assistance without confusion or interruption.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Text messaging is a powerful channel that can benefit businesses in various ways. It’s time to add it to your business communications, for both the benefit of your company and the customer.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a lot of call center metrics out there that measure customer satisfaction—CSAT, Net Promoter Score (NPS), even First Call Resolution (FCR). The way they measure satisfaction is different, but the end result is the same—to make sure the customer is happy.</p>
<p>But what if I told you there was a call center metric that could do nothing but measure a customer’s happiness, one that tracked their satisfaction through every interaction?</p>
<p>There is, and it’s called the Smiley Face Index (SFI).</p>
<h1><span id="more-7264"></span><strong>What is the Smiley Face Index?</strong></h1>
<p>The Smiley Face Index isn’t meant to displace other more complex call center metrics.  Rather, it’s just the simpler way of looking at customer satisfaction that we sometimes need. It literally measures the number of smiley faces exchanged by a customer and agent during a web-chat or text message interaction. Simply put, more smiley faces = more happy customers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.icmi.com/~/media/Images/Resources/Articles/2015/09/SmileyIndex.ashx" alt="call center metrics smile" width="461" height="165" /></p>
<p>Smiley faces are symbols that have meaning—they show how happy or excited we are. And while The Smiley Face Index might not be as all-encompassing or sophisticated as other metrics, it is a great way to get a feel for current customer sentiment, and also assess agent performance in real time.</p>
<p>For example, if Agent A is has 10 interactions with customers and none of the customers send smiley faces, that could mean one of two things: either they didn’t feel like sending a smiley face, or the service provided didn’t warrant a smiley face.</p>
<p>However, if Agent B has 10 interactions with customers and 7 out of 10 send smiley faces, then, as a contact center manager, you can tell that that agent is doing something right. That’s not to say that Agent A isn’t doing a good job—it just means that Agent B is doing something that warrants smiles from customers.</p>
<p>And you can bet that even if a customer is prompted to give a smiley face, they’re certainly not going to unless it’s merited. However, it’s good to remember that <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118562/emoticons-effect-way-we-communicate-linguists-study-effects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">women are twice as likely to use emoticons as men</a>, as found in a study from Rice University.</p>
<p>We’ve even seen some companies close out their support tickets/sessions by simply asking “Have I made you <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> or <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ? Is there anything else I can help you with?”</p>
<p>Ultimately, if no agents are getting smiley faces, it could be an indicator that the current level of service is worth putting some thought into.</p>
<h1><strong>What makes SFI different from other call center metrics</strong></h1>
<p>While the Smiley Face Index can be subjective, it is a quick, practical tool that you can use right away to get a quick “thermometer-read” at any given time &#8211; real time&#8230;like the heartbeat monitor of happiness.</p>
<p>You see, the point of the Smiley Face Index isn’t to get the most smiley faces—it’s to provide such great service that you make your customer smile. A lot of other metrics and measurements around customer satisfaction don’t address that—they deal strictly with numbers and scores, with definitions and averages.</p>
<p>The genius of the Smiley Face Index is that it eschews all the <strong>common call center metrics</strong> (which are all very important, don’t get me wrong) to focus on the importance of pleasing customers and making it a daily focus. It literally tracks whether or not the experience you’re providing can garner a  smile. If you review a digital interaction ending in a smiley face, you can see what was so good about it and build off of that. Was it resolved on the first try? Was it handled in under X minutes? You can learn from that experience to build better ones.</p>
<h1><strong>Service with a smile</strong></h1>
<p>One of our clients, a staffing agency, decided to offer customers the ability to text after using a clunky IVR for several years. They let customers channel pivot from voice to SMS and were able to deflect over 40% of calls to SMS.</p>
<p><a href="https://helix.northwestern.edu/article/kindness-contagious-new-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kindness has been shown to be contagious</a>, so if one person is happy and shares that (ie a customer), it will make the agent happy as well. Positive feedback is shown to be “<a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ayelet.fishbach/research/FEF%20Compass%202010.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more effective in goal pursuit</a>”, which we could build on to mean that tracking SFI could help agents do their job better. In fact, studies have found that positive people are also better at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2580208/Does-happiness-make-SMARTER-Positive-people-better-solving-problems-unhappy-counterparts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">solving problems</a>.</p>
<p>Another one of our clients, a health and wellness company, deployed SMS support for their VIP users. The users were ecstatic about being able to text for support, saying things like “I love it” or sending a smiley face. In this case, the new users were shown something happy (a new service that was a benefit of their membership) and were excited to start using it (saying, “this is crazy awesome!”). In addition, a smiley face <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> is the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcc4.12063/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most-used emoticon</a>, and a<a href="http://news.psu.edu/story/358366/2015/05/21/research/emoticons-may-signal-better-customer-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gents who use emoticons</a> are more likely to receive higher scores than agents who don’t use emoticons. That could be because “<a href="http://www.herizons.ca/node/554" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the emoticon is arguably a linguistic strengthener</a> that enhances the recipient’s understanding of the tone behind the text.”</p>
<p>Simply put, happiness (and smiles) broaden your mind.</p>
<p>There are plenty of examples of customer experiences that have made customers smile—what makes customers happy will ultimately vary by industry or channel. However, the Smiley Face Index should, at the very least, be a new way of looking at something, or at the very best, be a force for galvanizing change and prioritizing happiness, for your customers and your agents.</p>
<h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>
<p>Now, The Smiley Face Index isn’t meant to replace traditional call center metrics, nor should it. It’s supposed to be another perspective on achieving what should be each contact center’s ultimate goal—making the customer happy.</p>
<p>So, are you delivering service worth smiling about?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Contact centers need to get ready to get digital.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Global-Microsites/CCBenchmarking">2015 Global Contact Centre Benchmarking Report</a> by Dimension Data, digital interaction will outpace voice interaction within the next two years. Digital interactions currently comprise 35% of customer interactions: this includes IVR, text messaging, mobile applications, social media, websites, and more. This is in line with customers&#8217; demand for a seamless omnichannel experience, one that&#8217;s more contextualized and personalized on every channel.</p>
<p><span id="more-7214"></span>The report also found that nearly 75% of organizations believe the contact center is a competitive differentiator, and one of the best ways to stay competitive is to provide the best customer experience. With voice traffic predicted to decrease 42% in the next two years, offering great service on alternative channels will be more important than ever. Luckily, 35% of agents are now skilled in managing multiple channels, and that number will only increase over the next few years.</p>
<p>Also of note: 38% of contact centers currently offer SMS, and 23% have plans to add it in the next 12 months. That means 61% of contact centers will offer SMS support in 2016.</p>
<p>View the summary report from <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Global-Microsites/CCBenchmarking">Dimension Data&#8217;s website</a>, and don’t forget to download our <a href="http://onereachcontactcenter.com/high-demand-for-customer-service-via-text-message/">free Harris report</a> about America’s preference for texting.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">People often get criticized for having their head in the clouds, but for your contact center, there’s no better place to be.<a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2013_14_benchmarking%20summary%20report.pdf"> Over 65% of businesses</a> are already using cloud-based applications, and<a href="http://www.connectfirst.com/resource/infographic-key-contact-center-trends-investment-priorities-for-2014/"> 46% of contact centers</a> planned to move their contact center to the cloud by mid-2015.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the best reasons to do so is cloud-based SaaS. This technology is a pretty big deal because now it’s easier than ever for companies to get business done in a timely and cost-effective manner. Under the cloud SaaS model, contact centers can essentially “rent” the software they need to use on a subscription basis. The “cloud” part is exactly what it sounds like&#8211;instead of downloading software directly on a computer, contact centers can access the software they need anywhere, anytime.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7188"></span>This is important because in the past, contact centers had previously been limited to using the software on their computer. They were also limited by cost—smaller contact centers couldn’t afford the large upfront fee for the hardware and software they would need to carry out their jobs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But now they can.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Below are 7 great reasons to start using cloud-based SaaS:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Centralized management.</strong> With SaaS, contact centers from Tulsa to Tokyo can get what they access the data they need in one centralized location (the cloud). Site-specific and company-wide customer information is available to everyone, meaning contact centers can provide a more personalized experience wherever the customer calls into. Sites that don’t have this end up lacking valuable customer context. Using SaaS, higher ups can also rapidly deploy changes within the organization over the cloud, saving the time and money it would take to do it at each site. In addition to decreasing the cost of hardware at each location,<a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=584"> SaaS ensures brand consistency</a> and can even be customized for client use.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic upgrades.</strong> Since the software is managed by the SaaS provider, contact centers don’t need to hire an IT professional to make software updates. When the SaaS provider makes a change to the software,<a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://blog.appcore.com/blog/bid/184656/5-Benefits-from-Cloud-Based-Applications"> the upgrade is rolled out automatically</a>, meaning contact centers can spend more time on customers and less on manual changes. And since SaaS providers have servers to accommodate the traffic of even the biggest companies, changes can take place almost immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Rapid deployment.</strong> Traditional software takes a while to install on every single company computer, but companies can have cloud-based applications up and running in little to no time at all. For companies in a hurry, most applications offer a<a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://torchlms.com/learning-technology/benefits-of-software-as-a-service/"> full-feature trial account</a> that they can access as fast as they can enter their credit card information.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability.</strong> SaaS offers companies of all sizes solutions that fit their needs. Since a small contact center won’t have the same traffic volume as a large one, and a cloud-based application lets them pay based on the amount of traffic they receive. If and when your business grows, a cloud-based application will be able to accommodate it.</li>
<li><strong>Cost.</strong> SaaS solutions are pay as you go, meaning smaller contact centers aren’t saddled with an upfront fee they can’t afford. But even big companies can benefit from the SaaS subscription, saving money that would normally be spent on hardware or a hefty licensing fee and putting it towards the customer experience. Everybody wins!</li>
<li><strong>Mobility.</strong> Traditional software was limited by whatever computer you installed it on. However, SaaS lets you access your applications on the go, helping contact centers stay in touch with customers at all times. Today, providing a mobile solution has become especially important, given the fact that over<a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/mobile-technology-fact-sheet/"> 58% of Americans have smartphones</a> with access to applications. If you’re out of the office, you don’t need to lug a laptop with you—everything you need is just a simple click away.</li>
<li><strong>API integration.</strong> One of the great features of cloud-based applications is that they can integrate with other cloud-based applications. For example,<a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.salesforce.com/saas/benefits-of-saas/"> if you have all your customer data stored in Salesforce</a>, you can use an API (application programming interface) to connect all that data to another cloud-based application like OneReach. This eliminates the time consuming process of manual data entry and takes advantage of other software you’re currently using. If you can dream up a connection between two programs, an API can do it.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">SaaS use is only going to grow.<a href="http://www.juniperresearch.com/viewpressrelease.php?pr=441"> Juniper Research predicts</a> that SaaS revenue will reach $53.8 billion in 2018, up from $23.2 billion in 2013. Make sure your business doesn’t miss out.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Providing the best <a class="zem_slink" title="Customer experience" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_experience" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia noopener noreferrer">customer experience</a> can be a daunting task, but Whitepages&#8217; Jordan Reynolds has a few ideas on how to do it. In his blog post, Reynolds writes that customers are looking for a personal, one-on-one interaction, with a small-town, coffee house kind of feel. Reynolds had the chance to talk with OneReach&#8217;s Kevin Fredrick, who pointed out that &#8220;customers just want to feel known over the phone&#8221; and that context helps provide that.</p>
<p><span id="more-7165"></span>Reynolds could definitely relate:</p>
<blockquote>[Context] will hopefully avoid the dreaded customer experience of trying to explain to a contact center agent how to spell their name or address (agents regularly struggle to transcribe my hometown, Sammamish, WA, so I know the pain). All of these hurdles can be avoided by providing your contact center reps with the right information at the point of interaction.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">No matter what industry your business is operating in, it can undoubtedly benefit from multiple channels of communication. By contacting customers in real-time, your business can make sure they are receiving the attention that they need, when they need it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&#8217;s time to take your contact center into the 21st century with SMS.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span id="more-7161"></span><strong>How Will A New Channel Benefit Your Customers?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">SMS of the past enhanced customer service by contacting customers on a channel they used all the time. From special promotions to providing valuable contact information, these businesses majorly benefited from this one-way form of communication. But one-way unquestionably limits the potential of what true communication should be, and that&#8217;s why new technology is changing the SMS texting platform. With platforms like OneReach, not only can businesses text their customers, but their customers can text them back.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Contact centers should also incorporate intelligent automation. When a customer calls in, the customer service representative should be provided with an easy-to-navigate interface that showed all of the customers&#8217; previous interactions with the company. From previous purchases to returns, these details could be used to optimize the service the representative provides. With newer technology, this is exactly what businesses get.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Using New Technology: Understanding the Costs</h2>
<p dir="ltr">With <a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/63871-omnichannel-customer-service-stats-and-infographics#i.hx43yf3qfdv8qt">78 percent of consumers</a> stating that they base their purchasing decisions on the customer service reputation of a company, it becomes clear to see just how imperative it is that you revamp your customer experience policies to the max. And this of course means providing them with a multitude of convenient lines of communication. It’s not necessarily that certain channels are better than others. Rather, it’s about providing customers with the option to choose the experience they want.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Technology lets customers to text your business via 1-800 numbers. Moreso, live agent interaction gets smoothly connected with automation, making it a very cost-efficient form of customer service to implement.  Overall, you&#8217;ll enjoy not only happier call center employees, but more importantly, satisfied customers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But what about the cost of implementing this new type of technology? If it exceeds your overall budget for providing customer service, then you will of course need to find a regimen that stays in-line with the monies you have to meet the needs of your customers. Do keep in mind that you may need to re-orchestrate your funds so that budget constraints do not limit your ability to take advantage of an all-in-one customer service experience. However, depending on your size and needs, there are many cost-friendly options.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Easy to Implement, Easy to Use</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.retailtouchpoints.com/features/executive-viewpoints/engaged-employees-drive-the-omnichannel-experience">40 percent of employees</a> state that they have no idea what programs are going to be implemented until after they have already been rolled out. Don&#8217;t let your employees fall into this category. By taking advantage of new call center technology, seamless training and integration within your overall business operation is possible. Fully customizable integrations mean that you can save on training, as new channels will simply build upon your current software.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gone are the days of having to keep your customers on hold. Gone are the days of one-way SMS messaging. With today&#8217;s technological advancements on your side, a new horizon is taking shape, and it&#8217;s up to you to soar above it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Meet the caller ID of the 21st century: the screen pop.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A screen pop is exactly what you’d think it is—a notification that appears on your screen when someone calls you. Despite its simple name, it’s actually a pretty advanced technology. Instead of just displaying a caller’s name, screen pops can draw from software you’re already using to display a customer’s service history, including past appointments and correspondences.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7146"></span>This technology is a game changer for any business that fields a lot of calls. Using screen pops, high volume and high value locations can manage calls more efficiently with immediate access to a customer’s background information. Having customer data available before the conversation even starts allows businesses to prioritize calls by importance, the time they came in, or any other metric.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thanks to cloud technology, businesses can route incoming office calls to their mobile phone without customers knowing the difference. Systems like OneReach utilize customer data from different databases and incorporate that into the screen pop. Here’s how it might look on a computer screen:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ld8i-au5tJBDcvSh6NDqUx-CaKdnQYyN7_3PXFBQgIhc8nhOrSNdF4nttWYIf_Sd7VR2ks0Z2KFQOZvGi-m6_l8FeDi7NEyUlQ9UfA1f9Wn0Hdl43DYOpflqcSb7g-EtvA" alt="screen-pop.png" width="423px;" height="265px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Even when business professionals aren’t in the office, screen pops connect them to a mobilized world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For a place like a doctor’s office that faces a busy front desk on a daily basis, screen pops could be a lifesaver. If there are five calls coming in and there’s two walk-in patients standing in front of you, it’s hard to process who you should attend to first. With screen pops, you can put patients that call on hold or divert them to another employee (without having to pick up the phone) while you talk to the walk-ins. Crisis averted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Business that use screen pops will see a lot of benefits, most notably:</p>

<li><strong>Saving time.</strong> <a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.kana.com/customer-service/white-papers/forrester-your-customers-are-demanding-omni-channel-communications.pdf">According to research by Forrester</a>, 71% of customers say that one of the most important things a company can do is value their time. With screen pops, agents and customers can experience quicker service. Using a platform like OneReach, businesses no longer have to answer the phone to “handle” a call—they can answer, transfer, or hold a call with the click of a button instead of making customers wait.</li>
<li><strong>Delivering a better experience.</strong> <a style="font-style: normal;" href="https://fonolo.com/blog/2013/09/17-important-customer-experience-statistics-for-the-call-center/">80% of companies</a> want to differentiate themselves based on their customer experience, and introducing screen pop is a way to do that. Screen pops delivers the context that a simple contact name can’t. With customer information at their fingertips, agents can draw on past interactions to make the conversation more personal and tailored to their specific needs and wants.</li>
<li><strong>Increasing availability.</strong> <a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.avaya.com/usa/perspectives/articles/most-companies-still-struggling-with-byod-policies-capabilities">According to research by Avaya</a>, 79% of employers say using mobile devices for work is a top priority. As the mobilized workforce grows, being able to conduct business outside traditional hours is more important than ever. With screen pops, businesses can answer calls that come into their desk phone on their cell phone and still see all the relevant customer information.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">You’ve been able to screen calls on your personal phone; why can&#8217;t you do this for your business?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The following provides a rough outline of what needs to be considered when implementing text messaging services in a contact center or business. While some of these items may seem daunting they can actually be completed pretty quickly depending on the size and scope of the implementation.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7144"></span></p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Identify text support targets (Based on value and feasibility)</strong> – Not everything can be or should be supported through text messaging. Companies should consider using texting for support tasks that can be resolved quickly or that can reduce customer wait time. (such as order or ticket status) Tasks that require sensitive data such as password resets or billing information should be avoided unless precautions can be taken on the implementation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Automation and Live agent blend</strong> – Over 60% of Americans who text would prefer to text a contact center with their customer service needs rather than call in. Companies should determine what level of automation is appropriate for each support task and when to include an agent. Some tasks can be completely automated while others can be only partly automated ending in an agent interaction. Using relevant data from back office systems during a text interaction can reduce agent chat time and improve customer experience.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Text support discovery mechanisms</strong> – In order for customers to use text support, they need to know about it. A common and effective way to introduce the concept of texting a business is to announce it in the IVR. Another option is to have a live agent inform them that they can send them a text message notification for things like problem resolutions, documentation, schedule reminders, etc. Websites and other online and printed material are also useful.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Customer experience plan</strong> – Because text messaging is such an intimate channel, it is critical to get the user experience right. Chances are if a customer has a bad experience they will decide to go back to calling your company and leave the text channel for good. To ensure that CX is accounted for during the deployment of text services, companies should consider establishing a UX outline, adding A/B testing support, and determine appropriate KPIs and reports.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Inbound/outbound mix</strong> – Based on the type of text message support services that are identified, the texting volumes between inbound automated messages, live support and outbound proactive notifications must be determined. This will help identify the type of text message solution to implement. Establishing a baseline of estimated inbound/outbound text message volumes can be done based on the type of task and the automation that will be implemented.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Long code vs. Short code</strong> – For common support interactions, long codes (a company’s 10 digit telephone number) can be used for 1-to-1 interactions between a business and a customer (1 to 3 is a rough limit). Long codes are more recognizable to a customer since they text people all the time. Short codes are generally better for large volume outbound blasts but can be used interactively as well. Both have their merits but long codes are generally cheaper, more flexible and can even be enabled for a companies 1800  number. Companies must consider MMA and carrier guidelines when determining the type of number and implementation to use.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Back office Integration strategy</strong> – As part of the automation strategy you need to determine which back office solutions are required for integration and what integration options are available. Common ones are CRM, Billing, and Ticketing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Agent staffing</strong> – While it is possible to use your  existing web chat agents to support text messaging support tasks, it is not always the best choice. Phone agents are usually trained to answer support questions and already have the required tools therefore it may make sense to have phone agents  manage text interactions depending on where the customer is in the support process. Also, since phone agents take calls, they can easily transition from text to voice and back if needed. However, it’s important to remember that text chat is not the same as a web chat. For instance, there are text restrictions (160 characters) and the type of interactions and approach will vary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="9">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Channel integrations</strong> – As part of an overall customer experience plan there needs to be thought given to how text messaging will fit into the overall channel strategy. For instance, will the customer be able to start on a voice call and transition to text messaging and back? How will agents support text along with other channels? How will you be able to track a customer’s interactions across channels? This might include the need to consolidate of Voice of the Customer (VOC) customer satisfaction scores.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="10">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Text support rollout plan</strong> – Once the decision has been made to include text messaging into the support mix, there are different ways to go about the implementation. Generally, starting with a pilot which is only exposed to a certain amount of the customer pool is the safest. This can be supported in a typical A/B testing fashion, such as only exposing the service to a limited amount of people that call in or visit a page. The other option is to choose one or two support tasks with limited use and track the engagement level. Data gathering and testing is the goal in the initial phases. Based on initial customer feedback you can iterate through the experience until you get the VOC scores that are desired.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Texting automation is the latest development in contact center technology. Also known as Interactive Text Response (ITR), SMS (short message service or “texting”) automation is part of an integrated phone technology platform which supports multiple channel communication. This system is designed specifically to improve the call center experience by managing customer problems in a quick and timely manner.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7142"></span>In the recent past, businesses could send SMS messages to their customers in the form of alerts, or other one-way communication. Technology has advanced even further, creating a platform where customers can actually text back, enabling two-way conversations with a live contact center agent or an automated ITR flow. This revolutionary change could kickstart the entire telecom industry. SMS automation not only provides a smoother, less frustrating experience for the consumer that still allows them to get in touch with a live agent when they need it. SMS automation also improves the lives of call center employees, decreasing the amount of calls they have to answer and allowing more time to be spent on the calls that need them. Receiving an automated answer to a question via text takes seconds, while the wait to talk to a live agent can seem like forever.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Fact: <a href="http://multichannelmerchant.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/LivePerson-Infographic.png">82% of customers</a> say that getting their issue resolved quickly is the #1 factor to a great customer experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 dir="ltr">Text-enabling call centers</h1>
<p dir="ltr">SMS messaging in the customer service space enables real-time communication between customer and agent, something that was previously only available over the phone. Instantaneous communication means that the customer is not tied to a phone call or endless IVR menu options in order to receive assistance from the contact center. With text, customers can exchange private information in a public forum without worrying about being overheard or interrupting what they are doing. They can also multi-task without having to put their life on hold; 81% of customers are frustrated being tied to a phone or computer while on a service call.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, customer service reps can have more than one text conversation going at a time, making the call center much more cost-efficient. Think about it: with live agent phone support, only one customer can be helped at a time per agent. What if you could multiply the number of customers helped at a time by four? Five? Wait times would be drastically reduced. Customer convenience is a top priority with ITR, and making service convenient includes making it fast.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Fact: 45% of US consumers will abandon an online transaction if their questions or concerns are not addressed quickly. (<a href="http://www.aspect.com/Documents/Papers/Aspect-NGCC-Forrester-WP.pdf">Forrester</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 dir="ltr">“Omni-Channel” Customer Support</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Not too long ago, customers only had phone or email to communicate with a call center. Thanks to technological advances, customers expect to usecan use channels like live chat, social media and text messaging to connect with businesses. They also expect all these channels to be connected so they can switch from one to the other without losing context. Providing customers with this “omni-channel” experience ensures that their problem can be solved on any channel, across channels. For example, ITR can notify customers via text that they are being transferred to a text chat with a live agent. With a platform like OneReach’s, customers can continue texting with a live agent, who can send and receive texts using the tools they already have for web chat.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Fact: 44% of customers would prefer to text immediately with a live agent rather than waiting on hold.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 dir="ltr">Intelligent Automation</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Building off of traditional automation, the idea behind intelligent automation is that a contact center will recognize the caller by their phone number or email address, and provide that customer with a logical dialog, or customized routing,  based on their previous interactions with the company. This can include addressing the customer by name, having the capability to pull up preferences, order history and previous conversations with the company, but all within the time frame of a single phone call. Drawing on those previous conversations, ITR can skip the IVR entirely and route you to the place you visited last or most often, expediting the process. ITR also can suggest various actions for the customer to choose from without the customer having to bring it up themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Fact: By 2020, customers will manage 85% of the relationship with a business without interacting with a human. (<a href="http://mktimages.gartner.com/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_92DB197B681D1A1003F701CB30B626FF3B111B00/filename/brochure_crm_2011.pdf">Gartner</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Most people want to speak to a human&#8211;they just don’t like how long it takes or how many buttons they have to push to get one. ITR lets customers resolve their issues over SMS or get transferred to a live agent for a more complex problem: customers can send and receive a quick response to their question, and live agents aren’t tangled up in the phone lines. With the latest in ITR software developments, this entire process is updated, streamlined and vastly improved with one goal in mind: providing the customer with the best possible experience.</p>
