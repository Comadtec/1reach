								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we look back on 2015, it’s tempting to refer to that age-old adage: “The more things change, the more things stay the same.”</p>
<p>This year, that couldn’t be further from the truth.</p>
<p>That’s because 2015 was the year the technology really made its presence known in customer service. Automation, artificial intelligence, social media, CRM integrations, texting&#8211;all were major customer service trends in 2015.</p>
<h2><span id="more-7370"></span><strong>Customer Service Trends in 2015</strong></h2>
<p>2015 was the year that:</p>
<p><strong>Customer service got smart.</strong> This year, artificial intelligence wasn’t just limited to the realms of science fiction a la Age of Ultron—it was also slowly incorporated into different companies’ service offerings. Amazon made its entry into the home automation market with Alexa, a virtual assistant that can field questions ranging from the time of day to traffic predictions to good restaurants nearby. On the enterprise-level side, IBM continued to expand the capabilities of Jeopardy-winning Watson, adding self-service into varied industries like healthcare, education and finance, among others.</p>
<p><strong>Customer service got automated.</strong> Over <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">55% of customers</a> would like a self-service experience, which provides businesses with the unique opportunity to speed up the customer experience while decreasing costs. In the restaurant industry, established chains like Outback Steakhouse and Olive Garden let customers <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Saving-Money/2015/0514/Restaurant-table-tablets-A-gimmick-or-actually-helpful" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">order via tablets</a>, while market newcomer <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/09/upshot/restaurant-of-the-future-service-with-an-impersonal-touch.html?_r=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eatsa</a> automated the bulk of the food delivery process. Automated self-service also extended to digital channels—companies like <a href="http://www.toistersolutions.com/blog/2015/10/28/automation-fail-how-attcares-stumbled-into-a-tweet-chat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AT&amp;T</a> automated social media responses (not always with the best outcome), while <a href="https://www.twilio.com/customers/stories/uber" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uber</a>, Snooze and more texted customers about the status of their ride or table.</p>
<p><strong>Customer service got focused.</strong> Over 80% of companies want to use <a href="https://fonolo.com/blog/2013/09/17-important-customer-experience-statistics-for-the-call-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customer service</a> as a way to differentiate themselves from their competition. But what defines a good customer service experience? In 2015, we interviewed over 60 industry influencers and found that the best way to <a href="http://onereach.com/resources/customer-service-report-2015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">improve customer service</a> was to focus on the employee experience. By focusing on employees and treating them with respect, companies can ensure that they pass that goodwill onto customers. Case in point: <a href="https://jobs.zappos.com/why-zappos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zappos</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/about/careers/lifeatgoogle/benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Customer service got diversified.</strong> In 2015, companies made an effort to diversify their service offerings, providing support on established and emerging channels.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mobile.</strong> In 2015, companies increasingly relied on mobile to interact with their customers. This year saw the official launch of Apple Pay, Starbucks’ continued success with mobile app <a href="http://www.nfcworld.com/2015/07/24/336798/one-in-five-starbucks-sales-in-the-us-made-with-mobile-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">payments</a> (more than $9 million in orders processed per week) and Magic’s simple but powerful text concierge service. As mentioned above, more and more companies saw the value of adding texting to their support strategy, making it easier for customers to contact them on a channel they prefer. However, not every attempt to implement mobile customer service was successful—Domino’s unfortunately disappointed some customers with the rollout of its text-to-order service.</p>
<p><strong>Video.</strong> Audiovisual communication has been popular among consumers for years, but 2015 was the year when video really started to gain a foothold in B2C interactions. Amazon’s Mayday is probably the most well-known example, but <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/28/this-is-webrtcs-yearor-is-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Express</a> and other companies helped customers solve their problems over video. WebRTC’s open source nature also made it easier for any company to incorporate video into their service offering.</p>
<p><strong>Social.</strong> 2015 was the year social platforms got serious about customer service interactions. <a href="https://twitter.app.box.com/customer-service-on-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>released a customer service playbook outlining the benefits of using social for customer service, as well as how to apply it to an organization. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/15/facebook-pages-can-now-show-how-quickly-they-respond-to-customers-messages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> also launched a new feature that keeps track of how long it takes company pages to respond to customer messages, giving customers better insight into the responsiveness of an organization. This is especially important, given the fact that over 40% of customers expect a response on <a href="http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-research/42-percent-of-consumers-complaining-in-social-media-expect-60-minute-response-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social</a> in 60 minutes or less.</p>
<p><strong>Voice.</strong> Voice is still king in contact center service interactions, but times are changing. Research from<a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dimension Data</a> found that while voice accounts for 65% of all contact center interactions, digital interactions will surpass voice by the end of 2017. And with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/07/technology/tech-companies-leave-phone-calls-behind.html?_r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet-based companies</a> making a concerted attempt to direct customers towards digital, with other companies ditching corporate <a href="http://www.inc.com/associated-press/jpmorgan-chase-getting-rid-of-voicemail-for-some-employees.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">voicemail</a>, it became very clear in that businesses couldn’t just rely on voice for communication.</p>
<p><strong>Web chat</strong>. Over 70% of contact centers will offer web chat by the end of 2016, up from just 33% in 2015. There are several reasons why companies would want to invest in web chat—it’s cheaper than voice, agents can handle multiple conversations at once and respond in real-time, etc. And there’s a reason companies from Nordstrom to Nike are using web chat to interact with customers—while 91% of customers are happy with web chat’s ability to solve customer support issues, 62% of customers are more inclined to buy a product if live chat is available.</p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>Looking ahead to 2016</strong></h2>
<p>2015 was an exciting year for customer service, with lots of progress made in digital interactions and automation. 2016 is set to be an equally exciting year, if not more so, as companies continue to build on the advances made in 2015. We can’t say for sure what will happen in customer service in 2016, but we’ve got a few ideas.</p>
<p>Below are our customer service predictions for 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Continued rise in cloud computing</strong>. In 2016, businesses will continue to migrate to the <a href="http://www.icmi.com/Resources/Technology/2014/05/Is-the-Cloud-Contact-Center-Passing-You-By" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloud</a> for its accessibility, storage, simplicity, and security, among other benefits. In fact, 88% of businesses are currently using the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2015/03/04/new-stats-from-the-state-of-cloud-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">public cloud</a>. In addition, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2015/09/27/roundup-of-cloud-computing-forecasts-and-market-estimates-q3-update-2015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner</a> predicts that by 2020, roughly 25% of organizations will use cloud-based CRMs. Cloud-based software-as-a-service, or <a href="http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/technology/publications/global-software-100-leaders/saas-trends.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SaaS</a>, will also become more prevalent, growing at a rate of 21.3% per year and making up 14.2% of software spending. <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/273642/worldwide-software-as-a-service-revenue-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SaaS revenue</a> is predicted to hit $32.8 billion in revenue in 2016, up 17% from 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Delivering on the omnichannel promise. </strong>In 2013, <a href="https://d16cvnquvjw7pr.cloudfront.net/resources/whitepapers/Omnichannel-Customer-Service-Gap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zendesk </a>research found that over 85% of customers thought companies needed to do a better job of providing a seamless experience. In 2015, companies were on the right track but weren’t quite there yet—nearly 50% of contact centers named integration of Web, contact center and CRM systems as their top challenge, with <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">integration</a> of systems to enable channel hopping close behind (41%). We predict that in 2016, companies will continue to take steps toward providing an omnichannel experience. Companies will find and use service platforms that manage and can integrate with multiple service channels/CRMs and similar systems.</p>
<p><strong>Personalization.</strong> This trend is a combination of the previous two trends—cloud services will enable companies to provide a personalized experience across channels. We predict that the ability to integrate customer data into service interactions will become increasingly mainstream in 2016, both in response to <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/07/14/consumers-want-privacy-yet-demand-personalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consumer demand</a> and a desire to differentiate on great <a href="https://fonolo.com/blog/2013/09/17-important-customer-experience-statistics-for-the-call-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">customer experiences</a>. The SaaS pricing model of most cloud services will also make it easy for businesses of any size to provide great customer service.</p>
<p><strong>Proactive customer service.</strong> <a href="http://www.wired.com/insights/2014/11/the-internet-of-things-bigger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Internet of Things</a> is rapidly changing our personal and professional lives. IoT-based companies, but other businesses as well, will leverage customer data to provide a proactive service experience. Although IoT is primarily focused on the B2C experience (think FitBit or any smartfridge), other organizations can learn from IoT innovations. Take, for example, the proactive service experience industry pundits anticipate will take shape in the IoT industry: <a href="http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Web-Exclusives/Viewpoints/Revolutionizing-Customer-Service-with-the-Internet-of-Things-105722.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner</a> predicts that by 2018, five percent of IoT devices will automatically trigger service cases.</p>
<p><strong>More artificial intelligence.</strong> In 2016, AI will continue to get smarter, and its presence in business will continue to grow. This is evidenced by the amount of <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/artificial-intelligence-in-business-the-state-of-play-and-future-prospects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">venture capital</a> being put toward AI-centered businesses, which grew from $75 million in 2013 to $300 million in 2014. And while <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/artificial-intelligence-in-business-the-state-of-play-and-future-prospects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artificial intelligence</a> is primarily being used for voice recognition and response, <a href="http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Editorial/Magazine-Features/The-2015-CRM-Rising-Stars-IBMs-Watson-Brings-Cognitive-Computing-to-Customer-Support-102108.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner</a> predicts that 10% of computers will be able to learn from past interactions by 2017. At OneReach, we’re helping to make this possible through the use of AI in IVRs or self-service.</p>
<p><strong>Moving towards a mobile-first future.</strong> Our world is becoming increasingly mobilized—nearly two billion global citizens now own a <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/2-Billion-Consumers-Worldwide-Smartphones-by-2016/1011694" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smartphone</a>. This mobile change extends to customer service, where 62% of companies think <a href="http://www.icmi.com/About-ICMI/Press-Room/2013-Mobile-Customer-Service-Strategy-Results-Released" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobile service</a> is a competitive differentiator and 64% of customers would prefer to text customer service. Texting is poised to make a big gain in the customer service field, with more than 60% of <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact centers</a>offering it by 2017. In 2016, we predict that companies will continue to provide customer service on mobile devices, whether it’s via text message, mobile applications, mobile websites, or other channels.</p>
<p><strong>More digital/emerging channels.</strong> As mentioned above, customer service interactions will shift to focus on emerging digital channels, both in response to consumer preference and cost savings. Take, for instance, the increased use emerging channels: One in four contact centers will offer <a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2015%20Global%20Contact%20Centre%20Benchmarking%20Summary%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> by the end of 2017, one in two contact centers will offer a smartphone app by the end of 2017, and three out of five contact centers will offer texting/IM by the end of 2017.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>2015 was a big year for customer service, and 2016 is set to be an even bigger one. We predict that new applications of technology like artificial intelligence and automation will define customer service in the coming years, as they already have today. Companies and contact centers that embrace the customer service trends in 2015 and beyond are poised to make an impact on the market that will be felt for years to come.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">People often get criticized for having their head in the clouds, but for your contact center, there’s no better place to be.<a href="http://www.dimensiondata.com/Global/Downloadable%20Documents/2013_14_benchmarking%20summary%20report.pdf"> Over 65% of businesses</a> are already using cloud-based applications, and<a href="http://www.connectfirst.com/resource/infographic-key-contact-center-trends-investment-priorities-for-2014/"> 46% of contact centers</a> planned to move their contact center to the cloud by mid-2015.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the best reasons to do so is cloud-based SaaS. This technology is a pretty big deal because now it’s easier than ever for companies to get business done in a timely and cost-effective manner. Under the cloud SaaS model, contact centers can essentially “rent” the software they need to use on a subscription basis. The “cloud” part is exactly what it sounds like&#8211;instead of downloading software directly on a computer, contact centers can access the software they need anywhere, anytime.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7188"></span>This is important because in the past, contact centers had previously been limited to using the software on their computer. They were also limited by cost—smaller contact centers couldn’t afford the large upfront fee for the hardware and software they would need to carry out their jobs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But now they can.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Below are 7 great reasons to start using cloud-based SaaS:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Centralized management.</strong> With SaaS, contact centers from Tulsa to Tokyo can get what they access the data they need in one centralized location (the cloud). Site-specific and company-wide customer information is available to everyone, meaning contact centers can provide a more personalized experience wherever the customer calls into. Sites that don’t have this end up lacking valuable customer context. Using SaaS, higher ups can also rapidly deploy changes within the organization over the cloud, saving the time and money it would take to do it at each site. In addition to decreasing the cost of hardware at each location,<a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.onereach.com/blog/?p=584"> SaaS ensures brand consistency</a> and can even be customized for client use.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic upgrades.</strong> Since the software is managed by the SaaS provider, contact centers don’t need to hire an IT professional to make software updates. When the SaaS provider makes a change to the software,<a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://blog.appcore.com/blog/bid/184656/5-Benefits-from-Cloud-Based-Applications"> the upgrade is rolled out automatically</a>, meaning contact centers can spend more time on customers and less on manual changes. And since SaaS providers have servers to accommodate the traffic of even the biggest companies, changes can take place almost immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Rapid deployment.</strong> Traditional software takes a while to install on every single company computer, but companies can have cloud-based applications up and running in little to no time at all. For companies in a hurry, most applications offer a<a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://torchlms.com/learning-technology/benefits-of-software-as-a-service/"> full-feature trial account</a> that they can access as fast as they can enter their credit card information.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability.</strong> SaaS offers companies of all sizes solutions that fit their needs. Since a small contact center won’t have the same traffic volume as a large one, and a cloud-based application lets them pay based on the amount of traffic they receive. If and when your business grows, a cloud-based application will be able to accommodate it.</li>
<li><strong>Cost.</strong> SaaS solutions are pay as you go, meaning smaller contact centers aren’t saddled with an upfront fee they can’t afford. But even big companies can benefit from the SaaS subscription, saving money that would normally be spent on hardware or a hefty licensing fee and putting it towards the customer experience. Everybody wins!</li>
<li><strong>Mobility.</strong> Traditional software was limited by whatever computer you installed it on. However, SaaS lets you access your applications on the go, helping contact centers stay in touch with customers at all times. Today, providing a mobile solution has become especially important, given the fact that over<a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/mobile-technology-fact-sheet/"> 58% of Americans have smartphones</a> with access to applications. If you’re out of the office, you don’t need to lug a laptop with you—everything you need is just a simple click away.</li>
<li><strong>API integration.</strong> One of the great features of cloud-based applications is that they can integrate with other cloud-based applications. For example,<a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.salesforce.com/saas/benefits-of-saas/"> if you have all your customer data stored in Salesforce</a>, you can use an API (application programming interface) to connect all that data to another cloud-based application like OneReach. This eliminates the time consuming process of manual data entry and takes advantage of other software you’re currently using. If you can dream up a connection between two programs, an API can do it.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">SaaS use is only going to grow.<a href="http://www.juniperresearch.com/viewpressrelease.php?pr=441"> Juniper Research predicts</a> that SaaS revenue will reach $53.8 billion in 2018, up from $23.2 billion in 2013. Make sure your business doesn’t miss out.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[&#8230;]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Communication is all about strategy. Customer-to-business communication, employee-to-employee communication, company-wide communication…all of these interactions can be analyzed and optimized to benefit the company. Now, with cloud based communication networks, companies can store all of their data and scale easier than ever before. Companies need to develop a centralized communication management strategy to go along with it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-7151"></span>Instead of sending customer information to different departments, companies can store it all in one centralized location (the cloud) for ease of access. With a comprehensive view of communications across channels and departments, companies will have a better idea of their overall performance. They can better answer questions regarding call frequency or employee performance against the number of calls answered. They can track the amount of new customers calling in or measure call volume against the amount of new business won each month. Companies can provide better overall analysis if all their data comes from the same source.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Just because you have multiple physical locations or a distributed workforce doesn’t mean that you can’t have a centralized communication platform. Cloud-based communications unite a company across departments and streamline the experience for customers. For example, if a patient calls a medical practice, centralized communication systems can direct them to different departments through automated service, rather than having the patient or employees punch in the extension number themselves. And instead of juggling multiple numbers, patients have one line they can call that will route them to the appropriate person. Companies also don’t have to pay for multiple phone numbers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Centralized communication systems store customer and channel data in one easily accessible location. If you don’t have a centralized communication system that can track this data, you don’t know what you’re missing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brand consistency.</strong> Centralized communication systems allow companies to offer a consistent and on-brand experience. Whether a customer calls the Dallas office or the one in Denver, they will be greeted with an experience that was well thought out and designed by the team at headquarters.</li>
<li><strong>Data.</strong> With a centralized communication system, a company can access site-specific data in the same place they access company-wide data. Companies can then measure the performance of each location against the national average, allowing them to track what is working well and what isn’t. If a customer needs to be transferred to a different location, their data is accessible no matter where they’re transferred to.</li>
<li><strong>Employee turnover management.</strong> By using company-owned numbers, businesses can better manage employee churn rate.
