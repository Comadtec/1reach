								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="u-text-m u-line-h-m">&#8220;Cognitive artificial intelligence is expected to be a big business as research firm IDC forecast that firms will spend approximately $77.6 billion on the technology by 2022.</p>
<p class="u-text-m u-line-h-m">However, organizations have to overcome often overlooked hurdles like linking disparate systems, to reach AI’s true potential, said Gagan Kanwar, director of business development at MuleSoft, during a recent webinar.</p>
<p class="u-text-m u-line-h-m">“Siloed data and lack of connectivity restrict AI’s ability to create real business value and turns it into little more than an expensive brain in a jar.”</p>
<p class="u-text-m u-line-h-m">When it comes to conversational AI, which incorporates machine learning and natural language processing, companies need to think beyond just deploying the technology in single-channel point solutions, added Kevin Fredrick, a managing partner at OneReach.ai and who also participated in the webinar.</p>
<p class="u-text-m u-line-h-m">Conversational AI is one of the prime ingredients in the fourth generation of robot process automation, which automates judgment tasks and consumes unstructured data while providing predictive and prescriptive analytics.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Among other important predictions, IDC believes that AI and machine learning will achieve adoption scale quickly between 2018 and 2023, and this will contribute to “500 million new logical apps created, equal to the number built over the past 40 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Calling the rapid digitization of competitors and industries a clock ticking loudly in the heads of every CEO, IDC advises enterprises that if they&#8217;re not digitally transforming their companies at an aggressive pace, that by 2022, just over two-thirds of their total addressable markets will be gone. Nothing short of a wholesale reinvention of enterprises&#8217; digital innovation capabilities is needed. These and many other insights are from IDC FutureScape: Worldwide IT Industry 2019 Predictions, the research and advisory firms’ top 10 predictions and key drivers for the IT industry over the next five years.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The protection of proliferation of user data were two big themes repeatedly touched up on by Bond Capital’s Mary Meeker at Code Conference 2019 earlier in June.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meeker’s Internet Trends slide deck covered the gamut of trends dominating the industry, pulling back the layers of Internet use at home, abroad, and for personal and business use. </span></p>
<p><strong>Key findings included: </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; For the first time in history, Americans are spending more time on their mobile devices than watching TV. A 2019 estimate reports that adults spent an average of 3 hours and 46 minutes on their phones per day compared to 3 hours and 36 minutes watching TV. By comparison, in 2009, TV reigned with 4 hours and 26 minutes per day while mobile use clocked in at just 20 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; An increasing number of people are using images to communicate: More than 50% of all tweets now include images. Platforms such as Instagram are amplifying this relatively new style of digital communication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; About 25% of people consider themselves always online. Among the 18-to-29 year-old demographic, that number jumps to 39%, according to Pew Research cited in Meeker’s report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; According to Nielsen, most television viewers are multi-platform multitaskers, with 88% of viewers saying they use a second digital device while watching TV, and 71% saying they look up content related to what they’re watching mid-show.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Messaging platforms offering automatic or optional end-to-end encryption are rapidly rising in popularity, with secured services like Telegram and WhatsApp outpacing the growth of non-encrypted messaging services like Twitter and China’s WeChat. At the start of this year, 87% of web traffic was encrypted, compared to just 53% in 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; When used properly, data and AI can improve customer satisfaction. In a survey of retail customers, 91% said they prefer brands that provide personalized offers and recommendations; 83% said they are willing to passively share data for personalized experiences; and 74% said they are willing to actively share data for personalized experiences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Seven of the ten most valuable companies in the world are now tech firms, led by #1 Microsoft, #2 Amazon, #3 Apple, #4 Alphabet, #6 Facebook, #7 Alibaba, and  #8 Tencent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Americans spent 6.3 hours per day using digital media in 2018, a rise of 6.8% from 2017 and nearly double the time spent (3.2 hours) in 2010.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Cloud deployment represented 22% of all American workflows, double the amount from 2010.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; 59% of everyday transactions in 2018 were done digitally, with 41% done in stores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; In 2018, 51% of humanity had Internet access, up from 24% in 2009.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Cyber-security continued to improve, with the average attack-to-detection dwell time down to 78 days in 2018 from 416 days in 2011.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A look at the full presentation can be </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/6/11/18651010/mary-meeker-internet-trends-report-slides-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found here.</span></a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jobs that are highly repeatable and performed in predictable environments, such as fast-food restaurants or basic data processing tasks, are the most likely to be replaced in the near future by robots, according to a report released by hedge fund Bridgewater Associates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These tasks require a minimum of interpersonal communication and would see more efficient robots and software solutions replacing humans who are more prone to error and slower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report used data from the US Department of Labor, focusing on how much time workers in various industries spend doing an assortment of tasks. The industries with the least-likely chance of being replaced with automated workers in the near future are healthcare and education.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Artificial intelligence is reshaping business—though not at the blistering pace many assume. True, AI is now guiding decisions on everything from crop harvests to bank loans, and once pie-in-the-sky prospects such as totally automated customer service are on the horizon. The technologies that enable AI, like development platforms and vast processing power and data storage, are advancing rapidly and becoming increasingly affordable. The time seems ripe for companies to capitalize on AI. Indeed, we estimate that AI will add $13 trillion to the global economy over the next decade.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the promise of AI, many organizations’ efforts with it are falling short. We’ve surveyed thousands of executives about how their companies use and organize for AI and advanced analytics, and our <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/breaking-away-the-secrets-to-scaling-analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data shows</a> that only 8% of firms engage in core practices that support widespread adoption. Most firms have run only <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/ai-adoption-advances-but-foundational-barriers-remain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ad hoc pilots</a> or are applying AI in just a single business process.</p>
<p>Why the slow prog­ress? At the highest level, it’s a reflection of a failure to rewire the organization. In our surveys and our work with hundreds of clients, we’ve seen that AI initiatives face formidable cultural and organizational barriers. But we’ve also seen that leaders who at the outset take steps to break down those barriers can effectively capture AI’s opportunities.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Chatbots — automated conversation systems — have become increasingly sophisticated. Should you design and deploy one that can interact with your customers? If you’re an executive making that decision right now, you may feel caught between A.I. hype on the one hand, and the fear that machines might not treat your customers right on the other.</p>
<p>Chatbots are a broad category that includes everything from Amazon Alexa smart speakers to automated text chat on a company’s customer service page. The most powerful chatbots — and the ones that can actually make an impact on customers’ experience and company bottom lines — are virtual agents. These are chatbots powered by an artificial intelligence that can understand and answer a wide variety of customer questions.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Artificial intelligence (AI) can augment or automate decisions and tasks today performed by humans, making it indispensable for digital business transformation. With AI, organizations can reduce labor costs, generate new business models, and improve processes or customer service. However, most AI technologies remain immature.</p>
<p>“To overcome this hurdle, CIOs must ensure that applications intended to serve a strategic business purpose, such as increasing revenue or scaling services, are designed for strategic plans,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/20865" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jorge Lopez</a>, Distinguished Vice President Analyst, Gartner.</p>
<h5>&#8220;AI generates insights that lead directly to business execution.&#8221;</h5>
<p>Lopez outlines six design principles that will help CIOs and organizations evaluate all proposed AI applications with strategic intent — that is, applications intended to help achieve business results, not just operational improvements. Applications do not have to follow all six principles; however, designs that show two or fewer principles should be reconsidered&#8230;&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Despite working in the human resources for over eight years for some of the top organizations in Canada, I have been somewhat blind to the future of work being driven by automation and artificial intelligence (AI). That is, until I read the <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018.pdf">2018 Future of Jobs report</a> by World Economic Forum.</p>
<p>According to that report, 50% of companies expect that by 2022, their full-time workforce will be somewhat reduced by automation. It is alarming to note that nearly a quarter of these companies are undecided or unlikely to retrain their existing employees and two-thirds expect workers to retrain themselves. This expectation raises an important question of how employees could know which new jobs they should retrain for when these jobs have not yet been created.&#8221;</p>
